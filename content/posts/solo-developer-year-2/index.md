## Project by project

### [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com)

{{< img src="zestful-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of Zestful website" hasBorder="True" >}}

Zestful was my first attempt at software-as-a-service (SaaS). It allows developers to infer structure from recipe ingredients programmatically. Given an ingredient like `"2 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley"`, Zestful tells the application that `2.5` is the quantity, `tablespoons` is the unit of measure, `parsley` are the product, and `finely chopped` is a preparation step.

| Income/Expense   | Amount    |

### [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

{{< img src="isitketo-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of Is It Keto website" hasBorder="True" >}}

Is It Keto gives readers clear, simple answers about which foods are compatible with [the keto diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet). If the food is keto-friendly, the site displays a purchase link and receives commission from any sales. The site also earns money from display ads through Google AdSense.

| Income/Expense           | Amount     |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Amazon Affiliate revenue | $1,314.81  |
| Google AdSense revenue   | $939.96    |
