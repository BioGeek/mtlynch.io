I still finished the year in the red, but I'm much closer to profitability than I was last year.

## How can you afford to keep losing money?

When I tell people what I do or even if they read my blog, people come away thinking that I fund my ventures by freelancing, but I've actually never done freelance work. I recognize that I'm very fortunate to pursue this lifestyle, and it comes from three main factors.

* Low expenses: I live in an inexpensive area where my expenses are around $2k/mo.
* High savings: It's hard to work for big software companies for 11 years without a healthy pad of savings.
* Lucky investments: I've been putting money into the S&P 500 for historically strong runs and I took small bets on cryptocurrency that paid off well.

## Project by project

### [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com)

{{< img src="zestful-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of Zestful website" hasBorder="True" maxWidth="550px" >}}

Zestful launched in mid-2018 as my first attempt at software-as-a-service (SaaS). It allows developers to infer structure from recipe ingredients programmatically. Given an ingredient like `"2 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley"`, Zestful infers that `2.5` is the quantity, `tablespoons` is the unit of measure, `parsley` are the product, and `finely chopped` is a preparation step.

| Income/Expense   | Amount    |
|------------------|-----------|
| Sales            | $5,022 |
| Hosting          | -$80   |
| Domains          | -$12    |
| **Net profit**   | **$4,930â€¬** |

After earning a flat zero last year, Zestful finally earned some revenue this year.

### [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

{{< img src="isitketo-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of Is It Keto website" hasBorder="True" maxWidth="550px" >}}

Is It Keto gives readers clear, simple answers about which foods are compatible with [the keto diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet). If the food is keto-friendly, the site displays a purchase link and receives commission from any sales. The site also earns money from display ads through Google AdSense.

| Meal plan sales                             | $24     |
| [Content writing](/hiring-content-writers/) | -$3,845   |
| Social media management                     | -$314   |

| Domain                                      | -$12   |
| **Net profit**                              | **-$2,158** |

Total of ~$2.3k of revenue.

38% of content writers was on writers who didn't work out. I either stuck with them too long.

## Grading my goals

In last year's update, I 


### Achieve $500/month in revenue across my businesses

**Grade**: A-

### Present talks at three software conferences

**Grade**: A

### Publish 12 blog posts.

Depending on how you count, I either published 9 or 13 blog posts in 2019. I had nine separate updates to my blog, but one of them was [a five-part series on hiring content writers](/hiring-content-writers/).

### Gain comfort with a JavaScript framework (e.g., [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/)).

**Grade**: A


## Raise prices, even if nobody's buying

One of the best pieces of [advice I received](/retrospectives/2019/07/#suddenly-everyone-wants-to-parse-ingredients) this year was from [Cory Zue](https://coryzue.com). He suggested that at $0.003 per request, my prices for Zestful were too low.

At the time, Zestful had almost zero customers. Wouldn't raising prices be the solution if I had *too many* customers?

In a way, I did have too many customers. About once a month, I'd get a request from a customer who said they wanted to use Zestful for their next project. They just needed me to add *one teensy tiny* feature before it would satisfy their needs. Eager to win a new customer, I'd spend the next two weeks feverishly implementing the feature they wanted. Then, nothing. They'd either stop responding, tell me they decided not to move forward with their project, or spend $5 on the platform and thank me for processing all their data.

I recognized that this kept happening, but I didn't know of a way to prevent it. If they asked for a feature, it felt unprofessional to say, "Before I decide to implement it, can you tell me the total revenue you'd provide throughout your customer lifetime?" Even if I asked more polite versions of the question, like, "What kind of volume would you need?" they knew nobody would take them seriously if they said they were a small customer, so they'd play up their plans for growth.

It changed the conversations. Instead of me having to guess about whether they were planning to spend real money, they were telling me up front because they wanted to use their volume to negotiate a lower price. Then, if they asked for a new feature, I could politely tell them that I could guarantee it would be implemented by a certain date if they were willing to pre-pay $X, where X is several thousand dollars so that I can justify spending several weeks implement their request.

## Stop outsourcing when it slows you down, not when you want to save money

This year, I substantially cut back on the amount of work I outsourced to freelancers, but not for the reason you might assume. I think people get too obsessed with paper profits and discount the value of their time.

Take Is It Keto. It's basically a content site. Hiring someone takes a lot of time. I have to write a job description, advertise it, screen candidates, negotiate compensation, then train them. For writers on Is It Keto, it usually took three or four months before the total amount of time I saved by outsourcing is a net positive.

TODO: Graph of time spent vs. time saved

Even this blog, I used to deliberately outsource all the coding so that I could focus on writing. I recently 

People are obsessed with profits. It seems crazy to 

It is a bad idea because it bogs you down.

Just because I outsource something doesn't make it worth outsourcing. I was excited about delegating all of Is It Keto's Twitter to an overseas freelancer, but I realized I was paying $XX for every visitor from Twitter and only earning back $XX..

## Idea screening is more important than a good idea

* Stone quarries: Most quarry owners weren't interested in talking to me, the one that did didn't seem to have problems I could solve with software.
* Email copywriters: 
* Sheet metal shops: There are existing solutions

Even What Got Done, which I did build, is something I deliberately bailed on because it wasn't gaining traction. My main goal in building it was that I felt frustrated that Is It Keto hadn't grown the way I wanted (it turned out all I had to do was let it sit for XX months), so I wanted a fun project where I could learn Vue.js.


## Goals for year three

Here's what I hope to accomplish in my third year as a solo developer:

* Earn $20,000 in revenue across my businesses.
* Present talks at three software conferences.
* Publish 10 blog posts.
* Learn one new technology.
