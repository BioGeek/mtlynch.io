I still finished the year in the red, but I'm much closer to profitability than I was last year.

## How do you afford to keep losing money?

When I tell people what I do or even if they read my blog, people come away thinking that I fund my ventures by freelancing, but I've actually never done freelance work. I recognize that I'm very fortunate to pursue this lifestyle, and it comes from three main factors.

* Low expenses: I live in an inexpensive area where my expenses are around $2k/mo.
* High savings: It's hard to work for big software companies for 11 years without a healthy pad of savings.
* Lucky investments: I've been putting money into the S&P 500 for historically strong runs and I took small bets on cryptocurrency that paid off well.

## Why I outsourced less

People are obsessed with profits. It seems crazy to 

It is a bad idea because it bogs you down.

Just because I outsource something doesn't make it worth outsourcing. I was excited about delegating all of Is It Keto's Twitter to an overseas freelancer, but I realized I was paying $XX for every visitor from Twitter and only earning back $XX..

## Raise prices, even if nobody's buying

One of the best pieces of [advice I received](/retrospectives/2019/07/#suddenly-everyone-wants-to-parse-ingredients) this year was from [Cory Zue](https://coryzue.com).

It changed the conversations. Instead 

## Idea screening is more important than a good idea

* Stone quarries: Most quarry owners weren't interested in talking to me, the one that did didn't seem to have problems I could solve with software.
* Email copywriters: 
* Sheet metal shops: There are existing solutions

Even What Got Done, which I did build, is something I deliberately bailed on because it wasn't gaining traction. My main goal in building it was that I felt frustrated that Is It Keto hadn't grown the way I wanted (it turned out all I had to do was let it sit for XX months), so I wanted a fun project where I could learn Vue.js.

## Project by project

### [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com)

{{< img src="zestful-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of Zestful website" hasBorder="True" maxWidth="500px" >}}

Zestful was my first attempt at software-as-a-service (SaaS). It allows developers to infer structure from recipe ingredients programmatically. Given an ingredient like `"2 1/2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley"`, Zestful tells the application that `2.5` is the quantity, `tablespoons` is the unit of measure, `parsley` are the product, and `finely chopped` is a preparation step.

| Income/Expense   | Amount    |
|------------------|-----------|
| Sales            | $5,022 |
| Hosting          | -$80   |
| Domains          | -$12    |
| **Net profit**   | **$4,930â€¬** |

### [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

{{< img src="isitketo-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of Is It Keto website" hasBorder="True" maxWidth="500px" >}}

Is It Keto gives readers clear, simple answers about which foods are compatible with [the keto diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet). If the food is keto-friendly, the site displays a purchase link and receives commission from any sales. The site also earns money from display ads through Google AdSense.

| Income/Expense           | Amount     |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Amazon Affiliate revenue | $1,315  |
| Google AdSense revenue   | $940    |
| Meal plan sales          | $24     |
| Content writing          | -$3,845   |
| Social media management  | -$314   |
| Graphic design           | -$163   |
| Hosting                  | -$103   |
| Domain                   | -$12   |
| **Net profit**           | **-$2,158** |

Total of ~$2.3k of revenue.

38% of content writers was on writers who didn't work out. I either stuck with them too long.
