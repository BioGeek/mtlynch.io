## Stats

### [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

| Domain Rating (Ahrefs)    | 27.0        | 8.0         | <font color="red">-19.0 (-70%)</font>       |
| AdSense Earnings          | $109.92     | $85.81      | <font color="red">-$24.11 (-22%)</font>     |
| Amazon Affiliate Earnings | $111.61     | $94.85      | <font color="red">-$16.76 (-15%)</font>     |

My visitors grew by 14%, but it's hard to know if that's due to general trends in keto or from actual improvements in the site. [Rough numbers on Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&geo=US&q=keto) suggest that search interest in keto grew by about 5% from May to June, so hopefully I'm growing faster than the baseline.

My earnings are disappointingly shriveling up. Amazon slashed their affiliate payout rates [back in April](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/14/amazon-slashes-commission-rates-for-affiliate-program.html), and that's been stinging Is It Keto ever since. I've tried to switch to alternative affiliate programs, but I haven't earned much through them (more on that [below](#being-an-affiliate-sucks)).

Ahrefs must have adjusted their algorithm because I dropped from 27 to 8. It doesn't *really* matter because they're just trying to approximate my ranking in Google's eyes, and my Google traffic has increased, but it makes the score a bit meaningless now.

## Keto interviews: they seemed like a good idea at the time

I thought it would be fun to . I was inspired by Dhruv at keto.fm.

## Being an affiliate sucks

It's crazy that I'm not taking on more affiliate partnerships. Realized that being an affiliate is sort of awful.

>**Merchant A**: Congratulations! You're in our affiliate program. Here's one link to our homepage that will give you an affiliate fee if users click it.<br>
>**Me**: Great, could you give me an Is It Keto coupon code? It's much easier to incentivize my readers to visit your site if they get a discount.<br>
>**Merchant A**: Absolutely! Your readers can use the code `10OFF` to get 10% off their order!<br>
>**Me**: So... that looks like it's just a generic coupon code you give to anyone. Will I get credit for sales that use that coupon code?<br>
>**Merchant A**: No, you need to get them to click your custom link *and* use the coupon code.<br>
>**Me**: Okay, so that's not really how affiliate codes work. Let me know when you can credit me for coupons, and then I'll promote your site.<br>
>**Merchant A**: Oh! If you want coupon codes, you should actually join this other platform we use to manage affiliates. They'll give you a custom coupon code.<br>
>**Me**: Okay, great, I've signed up on that platform.<br>
>**Merchant A**: Oh, we're actually not able to access information you submit to our affiliate program. Can you enter the exact same information into this Typeform?<br>
>**Me**: Okay, fine.<br>
>**Merchant A**: Great! You're now in our affiliate program again! You can find your custom coupon code in your affiliate dashboard.<br>
>**Me**: Okay, I just tried testing my coupon code, and it doesn't work.<br>
>**Merchant A**: Oh! Coupon codes are not valid for any of our flagship products. This is not documented anywhere and can change at any time without notice. Thanks for sharing this code with your readers!

I asked two others for banner ads I could include on my site to replace some of the generic AdSense ads. They sent me raw photos of their products and invited me to design my own ads and copy.

I'm not sure if I just have unreasonable expectations or the affiliate programs for the keto industry are kind of amateurish in general. I get the sense that most affiliates are Instagram or YouTube influencers, so they don't have any need for advertisements you'd include on a website.

## Legacy projects

Here are some brief updates on projects that I still maintain but are not the primary focus of my development:
