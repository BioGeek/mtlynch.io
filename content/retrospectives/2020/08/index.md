## Highlights

* This is my highest revenue month ever, at $9.1k across all of my projects.
* TinyPilot had the biggest first month of anything I've ever launched, at 52 sales and $8.7k in revenue.

## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Publish a blog post about TinyPilot

* **Result**: Published ["TinyPilot: Build a KVM Over IP for Under $100,"](/tinypilot/) which attracted 48k readers in its first week
* **Grade**: A

TODO

### Sell 10 TinyPilot units

* **Result**: Sold 52 TinyPilot units
* **Grade**: A+

TODO

### Write up the interviews I promised to my keto interviewees

* **Result**: Published the interviews to [Keto Cornerstone](https://ketocornerstone.com/)
* **Grade**: A

Keto Cornerstone was my previous project idea. Even though the project seemed like a dead end, I still had to finish publishing interviews I had promised to my interviewees, so I [put them up](https://ketocornerstone.com/stories) and tried to make the website look decent.

It's a bit difficult to calculate exact profits because I'm buying a lot of inventory in advance, so it would be tedious to dissect my receipts to isolate the costs associated purely with the units I've already sold. Instead, I'll say that my margins are around 40-50%, so the profit for the month was around $4k.

Not showing profit yet but my margins are around 40-50%, so I'd estimate . I'd have to do a lot of tedious accounting to match all the .

## Aligning the blog with my business (finally)

My friend Jen Yip mentioned that whenever articles about Lunch Money reach the front page of Hacker News, she receives a noticeable influx of new customers. Oh! I was just in it for the vanity. I forgot that Hacker News could actually be good for your business.

Other than vanity.

I've been lucky on Hacker News. In the past two years, nine of my articles have reached the front page of Hacker News, with several reaching the #1 spot. It doesn't sound like much, but it's pretty difficult to reach the front page of Hacker News.

## Managing inventory is hard

Ever since the blog post, managing inventory has taken up 30-40% of my time and attention.

I wish there was inventory management software . But the options I've found are either too simple or far too complex. At the simple end, they assume that your inventory is just items that arrive to you ready to sell. You're selling laptops, so the number of laptops you have in stock is the number of laptops you can sell. At the e 

Suppliers run out of stock. Suppliers don't really ship according to their estimates. My credit card maxed out.

## Managing stress is harder

It was scary. Outside of me, only one other person had tested TinyPilot. Only one person had tested .

## How can I make TinyPilot sustainable?

Right now, there's not a huge incentive for people to purchase a TinyPilot kit from me. As far as I can tell, there are two reasons:

1. They prefer to receive an all-in-one kit rather than ordering their parts piecemeal.
1. They're essentially donating money to me to show appreciation for the project.

Neither of these things is a strong incentive.

* Offer custom hardware
* Offer custom enclosures
* Switch to paid software.

Moving to less mainstream hardware naturally pushes people to purchase from me.

## Legacy projects

Here are some brief updates on projects that I still maintain but are not the primary focus of my development:

### [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

| **Total Earnings**        | **$180.66** | **$369.91** | **<font color="green">+$189.25 (+105%)</font>** |

I'm not sure why unique visitors declined when everything else went up.

In June, I experimented by replacing Amazon and AdSense links with links to direct affiliate partners and my own pages. I ended up making almost nothing through direct partnerships with keto companies, and even caught one of them cheating [cheating their affiliates](https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/hsfaq7/how_to_deal_with_merchant_who_is_defrauding/). So, I switched the ads back to 100% boring AdSense and Amazon ads.

| **Total Earnings**       | **$685.26** | **$18.05** | **<font color="red">-$667.21 (-97%)</font>** |

Zestful was fairly quiet. No new inbound inquiries. The small customer who signed up for an enterprise plan last month chose not to renew, as expected. Earnings on RapidAPI remained relatively flat.

## Wrap up

### What got done?

* Published ["TinyPilot: Build a KVM Over IP for Under $100,"](/tinypilot/), which led to a spike in TinyPilot sales.
* Commissioned a [logo for TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com/images/og-logo.png).

### Lessons learned

* Don't use Stripe to sell physical items.
  * Shopify is way better in every way.
* When ordering raw materials, use at least two suppliers for each item.
  * Split/rotate your orders between them so you're not at the mercy of a single vendor.
* Be skeptical of merchant-supplied delivery dates.
  * There's infinitely more accuracy in the delivery date from USPS/UPS/FedEx once it's in their possession.
  * On Amazon, eBay, and AliExpress, many of the merchants claim to be shipping from the US, but I suspect that they're ordering from China when you order and re-shipping the item to you.

### Goals for next month

* Sell 30 TinyPilot kits
* Implement TinyPilot support for mouse integration.
  * I'll finally be able to make an honest abbreviation out of the M in TinyPilot [KVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch).
