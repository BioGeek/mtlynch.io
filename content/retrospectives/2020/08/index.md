## Highlights

* This is my highest revenue month ever, at $9.1k across all of my projects.
* [Tiny Pilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com) had the biggest first month of anything I've ever launched, at 52 sales and $8.7k in revenue.

## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I declare what I'd like to accomplish. Here's how I did against those goals:

### Publish a blog post about TinyPilot

* **Result**: Published ["TinyPilot: Build a KVM Over IP for Under $100,"](/tinypilot/) which attracted 48k readers in its first week
* **Grade**: A

TODO

### Sell 10 TinyPilot units

* **Result**: Sold 52 TinyPilot units
* **Grade**: A+

TODO

### Write up the interviews I promised to my keto interviewees

* **Result**: Published the interviews to [Keto Cornerstone](https://ketocornerstone.com/)
* **Grade**: A

Keto Cornerstone was my previous project idea. Even though the project seemed like a dead end, I still had to finish publishing interviews I had promised to my interviewees, so I [put them up](https://ketocornerstone.com/stories) and tried to make the website look decent.

It's a bit difficult to calculate exact profits because I'm buying a lot of inventory in advance, so it would be tedious to dissect my receipts to isolate the costs associated purely with the units I've already sold. Instead, I'll say that my margins are around 40-50%, so the profit for the month was around $4k.

Not showing profit yet but my margins are around 40-50%, so I'd estimate . I'd have to do a lot of tedious accounting to match all the .

## Aligning the blog with my business (finally)

My friend Jen Yip mentioned that whenever articles about Lunch Money reach the front page of Hacker News, she receives a noticeable influx of new customers. Oh! I was just in it for the vanity. I forgot that Hacker News could actually be good for your business.

Other than vanity.

I've been lucky on Hacker News. In the past two years, nine of my articles have reached the front page of Hacker News, with several reaching the #1 spot. It doesn't sound like much, but it's pretty difficult to reach the front page of Hacker News.

## Managing inventory is hard

Ever since the blog post, managing inventory has taken up 30% of my time and occupied 80% of my thoughts.


| Issue               | Mitigation                |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Delivery speeds are inconsistent, especially when you go from ordering a single unit to ordering 30 units. | Split orders across multiple suppliers to hedge my bets. |
| Delivery estimates become less accurate when ordering in larger quantities. | Maintain a larger inventory, especially of less common items. |

I wish there was inventory management software . But the options I've found are either too simple or far too complex. At the simple end, they assume that your inventory is just items that arrive to you ready to sell. You're selling laptops, so the number of laptops you have in stock is the number of laptops you can sell. At the e

## Managing stress is harder

It was scary. Outside of me, only one other person had tested TinyPilot. Only one person had tested .

## How can I make TinyPilot sustainable?

Currently, customers can build TinyPilot without paying me for anything. That was, of course, what drew people to my blog post. But customers do still order TinyPilot kits from me, and I believe there are two reasons:

1. They prefer to receive an all-in-one kit rather than ordering their parts piecemeal.
1. They're essentially donating money to me to show appreciation for the project.

The problem is that neither of these is a particularly strong incentive. The majority of customers would prefer to reduce their costs by 50% by building their own TinyPilot.

When my blog post drove $4k in sales the day it was published, my girlfriend said, "Oh, great! You should do that every day." But the problem is obviously that I can't hit the front page of Hacker News every day. I need a way to give people their money's worth when TinyPilot stops being a shiny new project.

I'm looking for ways to make what I offer to customers more valuable than what they can build on their own.

1. Offer custom hardware
1. Offer custom enclosures
1. Switch to paid software.

Moving to less mainstream hardware naturally pushes people to purchase from me.

Because I'm a software developer, I'm leaning toward (3). I'm sort of bracing myself for a backlash of people who praised me for going FOSS at the beginning now feeling betrayed, but I haven't gotten any pushback yet.

## Legacy projects

Here are some brief updates on projects that I still maintain but are not the primary focus of my development:

### [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

| Metric                    | June 2020   | July 2020   | Change                                          |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Unique Visitors           | 46,386      | 48,231      | <font color="green">+1,845 (+4%)</font>         |
| Total Pageviews           | 109,721     | 118,980     | <font color="green">+9,259 (+8%)</font>         |
| Domain Rating (Ahrefs)    | 8.0         | 8.0         | 0                                               |
| AdSense Earnings          | $85.81      | $208.86     | <font color="green">+$123.05 (+143%)</font>     |
| Amazon Affiliate Earnings | $94.85      | $134.45     | <font color="green">+$39.60 (+42%)</font>       |
| Other Affiliate Earnings  | N/A         | $26.60      | N/A                                             |
| **Total Earnings**        | **$180.66** | **$369.91** | **<font color="green">+$189.25 (+105%)</font>** |

Over the past two months, I tried shifting my ads to [direct affiliate partnerships](/retrospectives/2020/07/#being-an-affiliate-sucks) and [landing pages for my sister products](/retrospectives/2020/07/#validating-keto-product-ideas). I ended up making almost nothing through direct deals and even caught one company [cheating their affiliates](https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/hsfaq7/how_to_deal_with_merchant_who_is_defrauding/). I've switched the ads back to 100% boring AdSense and Amazon ads, which is why ad revenue is back up.

It's now been two months since I used [programmatic page generation](/retrospectives/2020/05/#venturing-into-auto-generated-pages) to [grow my site's content by 50%](/retrospectives/2020/06/#add-100-new-articles-to-is-it-keto). It's still unclear if that's working. The new pages account for only 7.6k clicks from Google Search in the last 3 months out of 122k total, but it's possible that they're still growing and leading to more pageviews once visitors are on Is It Keto.

### [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com)

| Metric                   | June 2020   | July 2020  | Change                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Unique Visitors          | 369         | 440        | <font color="green">+71 (+19%)</font>        |
| Total Pageviews          | 995         | 1,247      | <font color="green">+252 (+25%)</font>       |
| RapidAPI Earnings        | $5.86       | $18.05     | <font color="green">+$12.19 (+208%)</font>   |
| Enterprise Plan Earnings | $679.40     | $0.00      | <font color="red">-$679.40 (-100%)</font>    |
| **Total Earnings**       | **$685.26** | **$18.05** | **<font color="red">-$667.21 (-97%)</font>** |

Zestful was fairly quiet. No new inbound inquiries. The small customer who signed up for an enterprise plan last month chose not to renew, as expected. Earnings on RapidAPI remained in the sub-$100 range.

| **Total**  | **$1,039.86** | **$9,129.33** | **<font color="green">+$8,089.47 (+778%)</font>** |

July was the strongest revenue month I've ever had. In fact, it was only $400 shy of beating [my combined revenue from all of 2018-2019](/solo-developer-year-2/#how-i-made-and-spent-money).

## Wrap up

### What got done?

* Published ["TinyPilot: Build a KVM Over IP for Under $100,"](/tinypilot/), which led to a spike in TinyPilot sales.
* Commissioned a [logo for TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com/images/og-logo.png).

### Lessons learned

* Don't use Stripe to sell physical items.
  * Shopify is superior in every way.
* When ordering raw materials, use at least two suppliers for each item.
  * Split/rotate your orders between them so you're not at the mercy of a single vendor.
* Be skeptical of merchant-supplied delivery dates.
  * There's infinitely more accuracy in the delivery date from USPS/UPS/FedEx once it's in their possession.
  * On Amazon, eBay, and AliExpress, many of the merchants claim to be shipping from the US, but I suspect that they're ordering from China when you order and re-shipping the item to you.

### Goals for next month

* Sell 30 TinyPilot kits
* Implement TinyPilot support for mouse integration.
  * I'll finally be able to make an honest abbreviation out of the M in TinyPilot [KVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch).
