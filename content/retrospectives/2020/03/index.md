## Highlights

## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I [declare what I'd like to accomplish](/retrospectives/2020/02/#goals-for-next-month). Here's how I did against those goals:

### Make $1 in revenue

* **Result**: Earned $100 in revenue
* **Grade**: A

I had affiliate partnerships with three different shows that agreed to pay me a percentage of any ticket buyers that used WanderJest's discount code. A crushing zero customers purchased tickets using my code.

I took in $100 in revenue by organizing a comedy scavenger hunt, though this revenue is probably not sustainable (more details [below](#100-in-revenue-but-at-what-cost)).

### Get 20 new user signups

* **Result**: Four new users signed up
* **Grade**: D+

I was expecting more users to create accounts in anticipation of the comedy scavenger hunt, but I only had four signups.

One of the new users is a comedian in New York, and I was excited that he used the [self-serve workflow](wanderjest-signup.mp4) I implemented this month to create his own [performer profile](https://wanderjest.com/performer/kersi.asare). As a cheat to launch WanderJest quickly, I created most profiles on behalf of the performers so that I could defer work on a profile submission UI. I finally added user-managed profiles last week, so it was cool to check the site and see a performer page I didn't create myself.

### Reach 2,000 unique visitors

* **Result**: Attracted 1,344 unique visitors
* **Grade**: C+

## My brilliant marketing plan

In my [last retrospective](/retrospectives/2020/02/#attracting-audiences), I declared that WanderJest's biggest challenge was driving users to shows:

>Ultimately, the thing that performers, venues, and show organizers care about above all else is **audiences**. Fancy features and promotions mean nothing unless I can demonstrate to show organizers that WanderJest increases their ticket sales.

When I shared WanderJest in local social media, people responded positively, but I couldn't tell if that was translating to real life show attendance. I needed a way to prove to myself and to show organizers that people were attending shows because of WanderJest.

So, I came up with the [Comedy Scavenger Hunt](https://wanderjest.com/scavenger-hunt):

{{< img src="banner.png" alt="WanderJest Comedy Scavenger Hunt banner" caption="The [Scavenger Hunt](https://wanderjest.com/scavenger-hunt) is a contest I launched to market WanderJest to local residents." maxWidth="650px" >}}

Fans can win prizes by attending shows and posting photos to social media. Comedians win prizes based on how many photos they appear in. Show organizers can contribute money to the contest to give their shows special status.

Here's how I expected it to play out:

1. I announce the contest to local news outlets, who are extremely enthusiastic to write a story about an ex-Google software engineer who moved to Western Massachusetts and formed a startup that specifically targets Western Massachusetts.
1. Residents see the news story and begin exuberantly sharing the scavenger hunt on social media in anticipation of the March 1st contest kickoff.
1. Comedians see how excited people are to participate in the contest and bang down my door to participate.
1. Die-hard fans compete for the #1 spot in the contest, and in the process build the habit of checking WanderJest for comedy shows.
1. Because participation happens over social media, the contest markets itself as people share photos from performances and tag WanderJest.
1. After the contest is over, hundreds of locals have created WanderJest accounts in hopes of winning the prize, and links from local news articles make WanderJest a top result in Google searches related to comedy in Western Massachusetts.

## My difficult marketing reality

On Thursday, February 20th, I sent out a [press release ](https://wanderjest.com/press/scavenger-hunt-press-release-2020-02-20.pdf) to seven local newspapers and TV channels. As soon as the email went out, I was staring at my phone, nervously awaiting the many requests for press interviews that were sure to come.

The phone never rang.

Of the seven emails I sent, I received only one reply: a terse, disinterested response from an editor saying that he liked what I was doing but thought it would be hard to keep going.

I sought advice from my friend [Heather Johnson](https://www.gozynta.com) for advice based on her past experience as a local journalist. She suggested that I reach out to reporters individually.

>I would find a specific journalist in each of the publications a direct email and introduce yourself. You need to make a journalist feel like it's their special day. Talk briefly about why you left \[Google\] and what you are doing now and then say you have a press release and you hope they can help you get it to print.
>
>-Heather Johnson of [Gozynta](https://www.gozynta.com/)

I tried that with eight individual reporters. I received an excited response from one, who recorded a TV interview with me, but it never aired. Another reporter offered to link to my event in the Arts and Leisure section of the paper's website in the next few weeks (not super useful, but better than nothing).

Promoting the contest on social media also turned out to be harder than I expected. Groups that welcomed my initial WanderJest announcement with open arms totally ignored my announcement about the scavenger hunt:

TODO: Comparison of website announcement vs. contest announcement

One of the ways users can earn a chance at the $200 grand prize is by re-sharing WanderJest's posts announcing the contest, but so far zero people have done that, save for a few performers, who are ineligible for the grand prize.

My plan for revenue was to have show organizers contribute money to the contest. I expected to lose money overall since I was offering $400 in prize money and expected to collect an optimistic maximum of $250, but I was happy to take that loss as a marketing expense. Unfortunately, with the frosty response I had from fans and press leading up to the contest, I had nothing to convince venues that it was worth their money to contribute.

## $100 in revenue, but at what cost?

By February 29th, I was still at $0 in revenue. But thank goodness for Leap Day, because in the final 24 hours before the deadline, five shows contributed a total of $100 to the contest.

I'm trying as hard as I can to ensure that each partner earns a return on their investment, even if it means I lose a lot more money. I had hoped the contest would promote itself on social media, but since that's not working, I ordered business cards and flyers and am hiring someone to distribute them in the area.

| Expense | Cost |
|---------|-------|
| Contest prizes | $400 |
| Graphic design | $140 |
| Flyer printing | $83 |
| Flyer distribution | $110 |
| Promotional cards | $215 |
| Facebook ads | $50 |
| **Total** | **$998** |

In other words, each dollar I earn costs me ten. This is not what [Steve Blank](https://steveblank.com/2014/03/04/why-companies-are-not-startups/) would describe as "a repeatable and scalable business model."

I never thought it would be so hard to give people free money. It's crazy to me that in order to let people know that I'm giving away $400, I have to spend an additional $600.

That said, converting this to a profitable model might not be so hard. If I demonstrate that the contest consistently brings in, say, 5-10 extra people per show, then it should be a no-brainer for organizers to pay $20/show to participate. It's the first time I'm running the contest, so I'm sort of throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. I suspect I'll find that certain advertising channels work better than others, people get most excited about only one or two prize categories, and that certain shows draw more contest participants. After the contest, if it works, I should hopefully be able to spend less because I can focus my investments better.

## Managing stress

Throughout 2019, I maintained [sane habits for social media](/eliminate-distractions/) and work-life balance. Unfortunately, since I started WanderJest, most of them have gone out the window.

It was easier to manage social media when it was a clearly inessential part of my day, but WanderJest is inextricably linked to social media. Almost all of the show announcements I track happen on Facebook, and the comedy world communicates primarily through Facebook Messenger. I used to set firm boundaries to stop working after dinner, but comedy shows happen at night, and when comedians agree to a meeting, the easiest time is before or after shows.

The contest is also stressful, as it's a Big Event with inflexible deadlines, outside vendors I depend on, and partners depending on me to deliver. It's also failing to gain traction, which leads to more worry.

I find it helpful to think about worst-case scenarios, so for this contest, it would be a near zero participation rate throughout the entire contest. It will be embarrassing to have such a public failure, but the upside will be a clear sign that WanderJest's model needs to change drastically. Show organizers who contributed money might be disappointed, but hopefully they'd recognize how hard I worked to bring audiences to them.

Here's my plan for reducing stress going forward:

* When I have WanderJest-related activities at night, think of it as a time-swap rather than a late work day.
  * If I'm going to be at a show for three hours in the evening, stop work three hours before dinner to work on personal tasks.
* Become more purposeful in checking social media and email at scheduled times or for defined time-sensitive reasons.
* Switch to a social media management tool like [Buffer](https://buffer.com) or [HootSuite](https://hootsuite.com/).
  * It'll be better if I can perform some of WanderJest's social media work without having to log in to the suck-you-in social media platforms themselves.

## Wrap up

### What got done?

* Organized and launched my first ever marketing contest.
  * Wrote my first press release.
* Added self-serve performer and fan profiles to WanderJest.

### Lessons learned

* When collecting payments from people, use online forms as much as possible.
  * Giving people my PayPal address leads to a lot of confusion and questionable deals where I make a limited-time offer, the customer ignores the deadline, and then pays me a discounted price that expired.
  * , and now they think that the official way to pay me is by sending money to my girlfriend's Venmo.
* Send press releases to individual reporters, not to the general editor.
  * If you're sending out a press release that the publication might not pick up, send it to an individual reporter with a personalized message about why you chose them.

### Goals for next month

* Limit work to eight hours a day and check social media only with
