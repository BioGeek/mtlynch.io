## Legacy projects

Here are some brief updates on projects that I still maintain but are not the primary focus of my development:

### [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com)

Zestful had an odd jump in traffic because a Chinese blog published an unauthorized translation of my [Second Year as a Solo Developer post](/solo-developer-year-2/), and I guess it gained enough traction that people clicked through to Zestful. It didn't seem to translate into any sales, though.

### [What Got Done](https://whatgotdone.com)


{{< img src="whatgotdone-april-signups.png" alt="Graph of 2-3 signups per day throughout April" maxWidth="600px" caption="What Got Done averages about one new user signup per day." hasBorder="true" >}}

The site now has 370 registered users. The problem is that the number of users who post updates regularly is about five.

I suspect that there are two problems here. The first is that What Got Done doesn't do anything to onboard users. They sign up and the app immediately presents them with a giant blank space and asks them to fill it in without much direction.

The other problem is that it doesn't offer the user tools to help them build the habit of What Got Done. One idea I've had for a while is letting users opt in to a weekly reminder email if they haven't submitted their entry for the week by Friday afternoon.
