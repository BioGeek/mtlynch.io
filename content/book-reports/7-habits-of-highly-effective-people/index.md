## What I Liked

* The author genuinely finds human behavior delightful and fascinating, and his writing shows it.

## What I Disliked

* I felt like certain topics 
  * e.g., the terms "character ethic" and "personality ethic" to me sound very similar but Covey uses them to represent opposite ideas.

## Key Takeaways

### Character ethic vs. personality ethic

* First 150 years of American literature on success focuses on principles, values, and how to deeply examine oneself to live with integrity.
  * [Benjamin Franklin's autobiography](https://amzn.to/2B8DOQP) exemplifies this type of writing.
* After World War I, there's a shift toward short-term, superficial techniques to achieve success.
* "Character ethic": people can only experience true success and sustainable happiness if they learn principles of effective living and conssciously align their lives with those principles.
* "Personality ethic": people can achieve success through short-term, superficial techniques like smiling more or remindig themselves of motivational catchphrases (e.g., "your attitude determines your altitude").

{{<notice type="info">}}
I wonder if this is a critique of [*How to Win Friends and Influence People*](https://amzn.to/3eMT1Ff), which came out around the time Covey claims this shift occurred.
{{</notice>}}

* Personality ethic strategies are sometimes beneficial, but they're secondary.
  * Character ethic is foundational to success.
* *Seven Habits of Highly Effective People* focuses on character ethic, a principle-oriented approach to personal growth.

### Maturity continuum

* The habits in this book move a person progressively through a maturity continuum:
  1. Dependence: Need others to sustain yourself and achieve your goals.
  1. Independence: You've achieved enough competence that you're self reliant.
  1. Interdependence: You find opportunities to work with others to achieve greater things than you can achieve separately.
* Americans tend to overemphasize independence and undervalue interdepence.

### Production vs. production capability

* In Aesop's fable, ["The Goose & the Golden Egg,"](http://www.read.gov/aesop/091.html) a man discovers a goose that lays one golden egg per day. He kills the goose in hopes of collecting the eggs all at once, but finds no eggs inside and loses his source of golden eggs.
* The story reveals a general lesson about managing resources and relationships.
* You must manage both production and production capability.
  * If you maximize production (slaughter the goose), you destroy production capability (get no more eggs).
  * If you maximize production capability (dote on the goose and ignore the eggs), you exhaust yourself (without selling eggs, you run out of food and money).
* Production vs. production capability examples
  * Physical (lawnmower)
    * If you keep using a lawnmore and ignore maintenance tasks, the engine and blades will degrade to a point past repair.
  * Financial
    * Withdrawing money from an investment reduces the returns it generates.
    * If we fail to advance our career, we get stuck in dead-end jobs.
  * Personal
    * It's easy to focus on the fun, easy parts of a romantic relationship while neglecting the difficult work of maintaining it (i.e., taking your partner for granted).
    *  It's easy to coddle your children and never invest time in helping them become independent.

### Habit 1: Be Proactive

* Most theories of behavior assume a direct relationship between stimulus and response
  * e.g., your genes give you your temper, your upbringing gave you neuroses
* [Viktor Frankl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Frankl) was a Jewish psychiatrist tortured in Nazi concentration camps.
  * He discovered "the last of the human freedoms" that Nazis couldn't take away: his response
  * Frankl could decide how he would allow the torture to affect him.

#### Proactive vs. reactive

* Proactivity means taking responsibility for one's behavior regardless of circumstances.
* "Reactive" people let their circumstances determine their feelings.
  * e.g., when the weather is gloomy, they feel sad.
  * "proactive people can carry their own weather with them"
* People achieve professional success by identifying probles and taking initiative to solve them.
  * Proactive: Identifies a business problem and creates a presentation pitching a proposal to solve it.
  * Reactive: Waits for someone to teach them how to make a presentation or solve the problem.

#### Reactive vs. proactive language

* The language we use reflects hte degree to which we think about things in proactive terms.
* We often say "I have to do X" when we're actually *choosing* to do X.

TODO: Table from p.78

\[***Ed***: This closely mirrors the idea of ["choicelessness language" in *Nonviolent Communication*](/book-reports/nonviolent-communication/#choicelessness-language)\]

#### Circle of influence vs. circle of concern

* Circle of concern: the set of all things in the world that occupy your thoughts, whether or not you can change them.
* Circle of influence: the subset of items in your circle of your concern over which you can have an actual impact.

{{<img src="circles.png" maxWidth="600px" caption="Circle of Concern contains everything you think about. Circle of Influence contains the subset of those things that you can impact.">}}

* Proactive people focus their energy on their circle of influence.
  * They care most about things they can change, and doing so expands the set of things they influence.
* Reactive people focus their energy on issues outside their circle of influence.
  * This leads them to focus on faults of others or in their environment and fosters a victimhood mentality.
  * This contracts their circle of influence.

#### Types of problems

Three main types of problems:

1. Direct control: problems we solve by managing our own behavior (e.g., exercise more, quit smoking)
1. Indirect control: problems whose solutions require influencing other people's behavior.
1. No control: we can't change the situation at all.

* We can address (2) by expanding our communication abilities to solve more of these.
* We can address (3) by choosing a response that allows us to live peacefully with the situation.

### Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind

>Management is doing things right. Leadership is doing the right things.
>
>-[Peter Drucker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker), the "founder of modern management"

* Good leadership requires you to know what you're trying to accomplish.
* Good management is useless without good leadership.
* You must decide what is your "center."
  * Your "center" determines how you judge all situations and make decisions.
  * If your center is something external like your marriage or your job, you'll make poor decisions.
    * e.g., if your center is your family, you'll be hopelessly distraught when your children go through phases of resenting you.
* Your center should be your principles because these can't change out from under you the way a job or money can.
  * Example: You have tickets to take your spouse to a concert, but just before you leave, your boss asks you to work late to prepare for an important meeting.
    * If your center is your spouse or your family, you decline the request but may resent your spouse for limiting your career.
    * If your center is money, you ditch your spouse to advance your career, potentially harming your marriage.
    * If you're *principle-centered*, you evaluate your values and which decision serves those values.

{{<notice type="info">}}
I either didn't understand this part or it's really stupid.

What Covey describes as "principle-centered" decision-making sounds to me like the normal way that everyone makes decisions: weighing competing interests.

Even if you have crystal clear principles, the concert example is still a difficult decision because it requires you to predict outcomes with limited information. Will your spouse's disappointment create a rift that ultimately leads to a divorce? Will your boss pass you over for a promotion?
{{</notice>}}

* Covey recommends drafting a personal mission statement and updating it regularly.
  * He recommends that families collaboratively draft a family mission statement and update it regularly.
  * For an organizational/business mission statement to be effective, every member of the organization should have a voice in shaping it.


### Habit 3: Put First Things First

>**Question 1**: What is one thing could you do (you aren't doing now) that if you did on a regular basis would make a tremendous positive difference in your personal life?
>**Question 2**: What one thing in your business or professional life would bring similar results?

* To decide what "first things" are, you need leadership.
  * You then need good management skills to prioritize those things so they happen first and consistently.

>The successful person has the habit of doing the things failures don't like to do. They don't like doing them either necessarily. But their disliking is subordinated to the strength of their purpose.
>
> Albert E.N. Gray, [*The Common Denominator of Success*](https://amzn.to/2BhDqje)

* The most extreme approaches to time management require you to [schedule every moment of your day](/book-reports/deep-work/).
  * Most people dislike having their day overly scheduled because it feels restrictive and leaves too little space for spontaneity.
* The proper way to approach time management is to focus on *relationships* and *results* rather than *things* and *time*.

* If we don't take the time to figure out what's important, we default to doing what's urgent.
* People who focus their time on Quandrant I just learn to manage crisis after crisis.
* People often spend time in Quadrant III thinking they're in Quadrant I because they neglect to think critically about what's important.
* Effective people:
  * Minimize time in Quadrants III and IV.
  * Spend time in Quadrant II to minimize their time in Quadrant I.
* The questions from [the beginning of this section](#habit-3-put-first-things-first) are meant to elicit Quadrant II activities that we're starving because they're non-urgent.
* To ensure you reserve time for Quadrant II activities, you must decline commitments that are not aligned with your goals.
  * Many people take on extra commitments to be polite but they don't reserve enough time to proactively handle important things.
  * This matches what Cal Newport argues for in [*Deep Work*](/book-reports/deep-work/#protecting-time-for-deep-work)
