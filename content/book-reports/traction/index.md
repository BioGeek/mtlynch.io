This book was thoroughly underwhelming. Dozens of people have recommended it to me in the past couple years, and I don't understand the hype. It has some insightful ideas, but they're buried under many wrongheaded ones and a lot of poor writing.

<!--more-->

This book is very much about breadth not depth, which is not necessarily a bad thing. They interviewed founders of successful startsup, asked them about what marketing techniques they've used, then categorized all the responses into sections.

Each topic has the level of depth you'd expect from a magazine article. The authors describe things based on secondhand information from their interviews. For topics I knew well already, I spotted little errors you'd expect from someone describing something from the outside. For example, the book claims that Joel Spolsky became famous for his role as CEO of Fog Creek Software, though in reality, it was due to his influential blog, [Joel on Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/). When they describe reddit, they confuse the concepts of "upvotes" with "karma." Their description of the ideal keynote speech sounded to me like the epitome of a terrible keynote speech, but that's a bit subjective.

The book would be interesting as a series of interviews, but it overreaches in trying to prescribe advice. It suffers severely from [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias). Some of the strategies they describe as successful seem to be successful in extremely rare circumstances. They give the example of [Grasshopper's viral video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exmwSxv7XJI), but that video is a huge outlier. Grasshopper got lucky enough in hiring a company called [Seedwell](https://www.youtube.com/user/pantlessknights/about) that was successful for a brief window in 2010-2012 at making promotional videos go viral. Can you think of any other viral Internet videos in the last 10 years that promoted a startup?

**Conflict of interest notice**: I admit I had a slight bias coming into this book because one of the co-authors is the founder of Perfect Keto. That company competes with [one of my websites](https://isitketo.org/) for search traffic using SEO techniques that I find a bit shady.

## What I Liked

* A good jumping off point for brainstorming marketing ideas for a startup or small business.
* They make a compelling case for "the 50% rule."
* The Bullseye strategy is sensible.

## What I Disliked

* The quality of the writing was poor.
  * Everything is in the passive voice.
  * Sentences like these felt like they were crying out for an editor:
    * >The way this step gets most often messed up by founders is by keeping around distracting marketing efforts in other traction channels.
* Lots of fluff and redundancy. The book could have been 30-40% shorter with the same information.
* The authors describe things based on interviews with a few subject matter experts, but I got the sense that in a lot of these areas, they have no firsthand experience.

## Key Takeaways
