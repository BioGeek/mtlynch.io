This book was thoroughly underwhelming. Dozens of people have recommended it to me in the past couple years, and I don't understand the hype. It has some insightful ideas, but they're buried under many wrongheaded ones and a lot of poor writing.

<!--more-->

This book is very much about breadth not depth, which is not necessarily a bad thing. They interviewed founders of successful startsup, asked them about what marketing techniques they've used, then categorized all the responses into sections.

Each topic has the level of depth you'd expect from a magazine article. The authors describe things based on secondhand information from their interviews. For topics I knew well already, I spotted little errors you'd expect from someone describing something from the outside. For example, the book claims that Joel Spolsky became famous for his role as CEO of Fog Creek Software, though in reality, it was due to his influential blog, [Joel on Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/). When they describe reddit, they confuse the concepts of "upvotes" with "karma." Their description of the ideal keynote speech sounded to me like the epitome of a terrible keynote speech, but that's a bit subjective.

The book would be interesting as a series of interviews, but it overreaches in trying to prescribe advice. It suffers severely from [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias). Some of the strategies they describe as successful seem to be successful in extremely rare circumstances. They give the example of [Grasshopper's viral video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exmwSxv7XJI), but that video is a huge outlier. Grasshopper got lucky enough in hiring a company called [Seedwell](https://www.youtube.com/user/pantlessknights/about) that was successful for a brief window in 2010-2012 at making promotional videos go viral. Can you think of any other viral Internet videos in the last 10 years that promoted a startup?

**Conflict of interest notice**: I admit I had a slight bias coming into this book because one of the co-authors is the founder of Perfect Keto. That company competes with [one of my websites](https://isitketo.org/) for search traffic using SEO techniques that I find a bit shady.

## What I Liked

* A good jumping off point for brainstorming marketing ideas for a startup or small business.
* They make a compelling case for "the 50% rule."
* The Bullseye strategy is sensible.

## What I Disliked

* The quality of the writing was poor.
  * Everything is in the passive voice.
  * Sentences like these felt like they were crying out for an editor:
    * >The way this step gets most often messed up by founders is by keeping around distracting marketing efforts in other traction channels.
* Lots of fluff and redundancy. The book could have been 30-40% shorter with the same information.
* The authors describe things based on interviews with a few subject matter experts, but I got the sense that in a lot of these areas, they have no firsthand experience.

## Key Takeaways

### Defining traction

* **Traction** is evidence that your company is satisfying a need
  * e.g., downloads of your app are increaing, more customers are buying subscriptions

### 50% Rule

* If your early customers love your product, but you have no means to find more customers, your company will likely fail.
* To avoid getting lost in the product, dedicate 50% of your time to product development and 50% of your time to marketing.
* Focusing on marketing brings you a stream of fresh customers who are experiencing your product for the first time.

### The leaky bucket

* Early in your product's life, investing in marketing is like pouring water into a leaky bucket.
  * You expose your product to customers, but most of them leave because your offering isn't complete yet.
* Most founders postpone marketing efforts because they see it as wasteful to market before their product is polished.
* Marketing is helpful even when most customers are because it helps you understand which gaps in your product are the ones that matter to customers.
* In the leaky bucket analogy, your bucket is still leaking, but marketing shows you where the leaks are.

### Moving the needle

* You need to pick marketing channels and strategies that will make a difference to your business if they succeed.
  * e.g., a tweet that drives 20 visitors to your website is good if you're brand new, but if you're already getting 10k visitors per day, that tweet is negligible.
* As you grow, you need to find new strategies that are appropriate for your scale.

### The Bullseye Method

* Bullseye is a three-phase technique to discover your product's ideal distribution channel.
* A business needs only one strong distribution channel to succeed, but most businesses don't experiment enough to discover their ideal channel.

#### Step 1: The Outer Ring - What's possible?

* For each traction channel, brainstorm at least one strategy for your business that could move the needle.
* Research successful companies similar to yours and learn what strategies they applied.

#### Step 2: The Middle Ring - What's probable?

* Test a handful of marketing channels at small scales.
* It's better to test multiple channels in parallel, as marketing tests take time and parallelize well.
* In each test, evaluate:
  1. How costly is customer acquisition?
  1. How many customers are available through this channel?
  1. Are these the customers you want?

#### Step 3: The Inner Ring - What's working?

* Take your most successful channel from step 2 and focus all your energy on optimizing this channel.
