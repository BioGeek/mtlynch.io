## What I Disliked

* The style of reflective listening the book advocates feels patronizing to me.
  * A: "I'm having a terrible day!"
  * B: "It sounds like you're unhappy because the day isn't playing out the way you had hoped."
* Many of the illustrative stories feel exaggerated or implausible.
  * He describes a time that he presented to violent gang members and told them how scared he was of them, and then at the end of the presentation, they declared him the best speaker they'd ever seen.
* The author really likes quoting lyrics from songs that he and his fellow therapists have written, but they didn't resonate with me.
* The grammar in his example dialog is odd and reads as if it's a non-native speaker.
  * e.g. "I am needing more respect in our dialogue."
* The second half was mostly examples of people putting the ideas of the first half into practice. I didn't find the second half as interesting.
