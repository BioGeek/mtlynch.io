## What I Liked

* Highlights the many ways that we unthinkingly use language that implies we have no control over our lives:
  * e.g., "I **have to** respond to this email", "You **made me** upset"
  * I appreciated the idea of accepting responsibility for your choices and your reactions to others.
* I've found many of his ideas helpful in improving communication with loved ones.
* It made me re-evaluate the ways I try to empathize with people and comfort them when they're upset.

## What I Disliked

* The book advocates a style of reflective listening that feels patronizing to me.
  * A: "I'm having a terrible day!"
  * B: "It sounds like you're unhappy because the day isn't playing out the way you had hoped."
* Many of the illustrative stories feel exaggerated or implausible.
  * e.g., The author describes a time that he presented to violent gang members and told them how scared he was of them. At the end of the presentation, they declared him the best speaker they'd ever seen.
* The grammar in his example dialog is odd and reads as if it a non-native speaker wrote it.
  * e.g. "I am needing more respect in our dialogue."
* The second half was mostly examples of people putting the ideas of the first half into practice, which I found not so interesting.
* The author really likes quoting lyrics from songs that he and his fellow therapists have written, but they didn't resonate with me.

## Key Takeaways

> **Nonviolent communication (NVC)**: a way of comunicating that leads us to give from the heart.

* NVC is a way of communicating in a more thoughtful way that focuses on our own emotions and withholds judgment.

* NVC process:
  1. Observe concrete events have affected your mood.
  1. Identify the feeelings that arise in yourself in relation to those events.
  1. Trace those feelings to your needs, values, and desires that generated the feelings.
  1. Request concrete actions from others to help satisfy those needs.

* Thinking in terms of judgment (e.g., "She's lazy", "He's unreasonable") places blame on others when the issue is really our own unmet need.
  * Judgmental language deteaches us from the issue and allows us to shirk responsibility for the feelings we're experiencing.
* People often describe choices in terms of "have to do X" or "need to do Y."
  * This language implies that the speaker is not making a voluntary choice to perform the action when they, in fact, are.
  * During the trial of [Adolf Eichmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Eichmann) (Nazi officer), he said that Nazis discussed atrocities in the language of "amtssprache" ("office talk" or "bureaucratese").
  * When pressed to explain why they committed war crimes, Nazis would give responses like "I had to."
* Examples of responsibility-denying language:
  >* Vague, impersonal forces &mdash; "I cleaned my room because I had to."
  >* Our condition, diagnosis, or personal or psychological history &mdash; "I drink because I am an alcoholic."
  >* The actions of others &mdash; "I hit my child because he ran into the street."
  >* The dictates of authority &mdash; "I lied to the client because the boss told me to."
  >* Group pressure &mdash; "I started smoking because all my friends did."
  >* Institutional policies, rules, and regulations &mdash; "I have to suspend you for this infraction because it's the school policy."
  >* Gender roles, social roles, or age roles &mdash; "I hate going to work but I do it because I am a husband and a father."
  >* Uncontrollable impulses &mdash; "I was overcome by my urge to eat the candy bar."
* The word "deserves" often blocks the speaker's compassion
  * e.g., "He *deserves* to be punished."
  * "deserves" attributes badness to the subject and implies that they deserve no empathy.
