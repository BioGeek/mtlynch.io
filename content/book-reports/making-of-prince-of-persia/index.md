It's the author's journals from 1985 to 1993 covering the *Prince of Persia* going from concept to release, failure to sleeper hit.

It's also interesting as a social time capsule. During game development, "a group of irate women" at the company collectively raise complaints about [the game's cover art](cover-art.jpg), which featured a busty princess having her wrist violently grabbed by an evil Middle Eastern man. The response from the men is sort of like, "Ugh, these concerns are *so annoying*." One of the men in upper management sends out a condescending email explaining why women are wrong to be offended, and then that's it! The matter is settled, and everyone moves on and they later celebrate how great the box art is.

It's a lesson in enjoying the present. Throughout his journals, he's never able to enjoy his success.

I enjoyed the first half a lot because it focused on the software development parts of his life. The second half of the book is more about him struggling to break into the film industry and working on

## What I Liked

* Fascinating, unfiltered view into someone's life.
* The Stripe version includes margin notes where the author includes context, present reflections, and trivia about people involved.
* It's impressive how eloquent he is in what he expected to be his private journal.
  * If I kept a journal from my twenties, it would be far less succinct or profound.

## What I Disliked

* Certain parts are a little hard to follow.
  * Because it's just verbatim journal entries, the author often omits context about who people are or what's happening. The Stripe edition has margin notes, but I wish there were a bit more.

## Key Takeaways

* Stripe, the payment company, [has a publishing house](https://press.stripe.com/).
  * They have several interesting-looking titles.
* Video game developers in the 80s and 90s were like one-person bands. They often did all the programming, graphics, and music.
* Before making a new game, video game designers first had to build their own custom tools for making each game from scratch.
* Video games were such a slog!
  * He spends like a year writing all the code pretty much in a bubble and then there's another year of quality assurance, bugfixing.
* Software engineering practices were so much messier back in the day.
  * Late into the testing process, the author is still adding pet features to the game, sometimes introducing severe bugs in the process and forcing .
  * Today, SaaS has let us go back to shipping without thorough testing, but what Broderbund did in the 90s was so different from my experience working at Microsoft in the 00s.
* The animation was so revolutionarily lifelike because he recorded his younger performing the movements and then painstakingly traced the frames.
  * The book includes stills from the original videos he took, and it's fascinating to see how closely the final game mirrored that raw footage.
