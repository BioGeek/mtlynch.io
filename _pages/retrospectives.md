At the beginning of each month, I take a step back to examine how things are going with whichever project is my current focus. These retrospectives evaluate how I performed against my goals and also set objectives for the subsequent month.

In the interest of expedience and freshness, I don't polish or edit them as much as my normal blog posts, so please forgive any mistakes or clunky phrasing.
