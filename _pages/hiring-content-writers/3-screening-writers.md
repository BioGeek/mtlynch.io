Obviously, you're not going to hire every writer you find. You need a way to evaluate candidates based on their profile. You don't have much information to go on.

Some guides recommend asking writers to produce a custom sample for you where you buy it if you like it, but "let them keep it" and pay them nothing if it's not what you're looking for. I don't do this, because it violates [my fundamental hiring principle](/hiring-content-writers/#the-fundamental-principle-of-hiring-talented-people). Top-tier writers have no interest in spending hours on an assignment that will only *maybe* pay them.

In this section, I explain how I screen candidates to filter out obvious mismatches, and how I select writers to hire on a trial basis.

## Evaluation criteria

Before you hire a writer, you have to judge them based on the information available. Here's what I've learned from my experience with these signals.

### Hourly rate

It's natural to assume that a $60/hr writer is substantially better than a $30/hr writer, but I found this not to be the case. The rate that writers billed seemed unrelated to the quality of their writing. On Upwork, the best writer I found was also the one who charged the lowest rate ($20/hr).

### Bio

If the writer has a profile on a freelancing site or, better yet, their own website, they'll have a bio that explains a little about themselves and the work that they do.

This tends to be the best glimpse you have into a writer's talent. A writers published samples often go through a layer of editing that the writer can't control. But the writer has the final say on the writing in their own profile, so it's the purest sample you can get of their writing.

If they have spelling or grammar errors in their profile, that's an automatic no-hire. If they can't get their grammar correct in their bio, they're never going to get it right in the work they do for you. Similarly, look for writing that's convoluted or unclear. The writing on their profile is likely the best that they can do, so if it doesn't meet your standards, move on.

### Writing samples

All professional writers should be able to provide you with writing samples, but they're not always an accurate reflection of their ability. Conversely, if the article feels boring and convoluted, it could be because the client asked for a 2,000-word article about a 500-word topic. The opposite can happen as well. The writer can have a sample with impeccable grammar and clear language, but it's because the editor of the piece cleaned up their mistakes.

When I read writing samples, I'm looking for writing that's either extremely good or extremely bad. I can reject extremely bad writing. If the writing samples in their public portfolio are so-so, I'll reach out to the writer directly and ask if they have a writing sample that's closer to [my site's style](/hiring-content-writers/4-working-with-writers/#use-a-style-guide-to-enforce-consistency).

### Ratings and reviews

Sites like Upwork keep reviews for each freelancer. In my experience, reviews have been the least meaningful indicators of quality. Some of the writers I've hired had dozens of perfect five-star reviews, and then they turned in work that was barely intelligible and riddled with syntax errors.

Negative reviews are a stronger signal. It's not a big deal if they have a couple blemishes on an otherwise solid track record. Some clients are just jerks and have unreasonable expectations of freelancers. But if you see repeated patterns in their bad reviews, pay attention.

### Publication credits

Some writers have fancy credits to their name, such as a previous article published on a well-known website like Forbes or The Huffington Post.

In my experience, fancy writing credits were not a meaningful signal. It's a good sign if another publisher liked their work enough to publish it, but I've seen several writers with . Articles in these publications are something of a confusing signal, because those publications generally have good editors, so if you see a writer who published a well-written article in a major publication, it might only be that good because the editor dragged it across the finish line.

## Pitfalls to avoid

### Steer clear of fluff factories

The Internet is experiencing an epidemic of fluff writing. Site owners [think that Google will place their pages higher](https://moz.com/blog/blog-post-length-frequency) in results if they have a higher word count. And many writers are paid by the word, so wordier pieces earn them more money. As a result, instead of learning to write well, many writers have learned to write fluff.

You can recognize fluff if it sounds like you're reading a book report from a fifth grader who forgot to do the reading. Below, I've included an example of fluff writing. To avoid picking on any particular writer, I wrote the passage myself, but it's depressingly similar to some writing samples I've received:

>Fitness is important. We all know this! A recent study found that people who exercise are better than people who don’t. So you don’t have any excuse not to hit the gym and start working on those extra pounds!
>
>But fitness won’t just happen. You have to WORK for it! The first step is making a commitment that will force you to keep a regular gym habit. It can be a pact with a friend or sessions with a personal trainer. Anything that will keep your butt off the couch!
>
>Don’t overdo it either! Many people start working out and push themselves past their limits and injure themselves. Make sure to know your limits and always stay hydrated.

When you're hiring, avoid "fluff factories" &mdash; writers who only produce fluff. Signs of a fluff factory include:

* The writing feels desperate to be interesting.
  * Hyperbole
  * ALL CAPS
  * Exclamation points!!!
* There are long stretches of text devoid of useful information or analysis.

### Beware the jack  of all trades

Good writers tend to focus exclusively on their craft. People who are "amazing" content writers and "expert" WordPress designers, in reality, tend to be weak in both.

If you were searching for someone to perform your brain surgery, you'd probably avoid the doctor who says, "I'm an expert neurosurgeon **and** an accomplished auto mechanic."

### Resist the temptation to "fix" bad writers

It can take weeks or months to find a writer that produces the content you want. During that time, it's easy for desperation to set in. Several times, I found mediocre writers and thought to myself, "Oh, their writing is rough, but I can coach them to improve it." This never worked. 

Writing improves slowly, at the scale of years. If a professional writer produces D-grade writing, they'll remain a D-grade writer for years to come. Remember that when you see an enthusiastic but mediocre writer offering to work at bargain basement rates.

## Proactively invite freelancers to apply

You can find higher quality candidates if you reach out proactively. The best candidates are generally not the ones constantly checking job boards for new postings.

When you proactively reach out, take the same steps as if you're evaluating an inbound candidate. Read their bio and check their writing samples.

Writers get generic spam solicitations all the time, so a personalized invitation instantly makes you stand out as a client who respects their work. Mention specifics about what you liked about their writing and why you feel that they'd be a good match for the job.

Be clear that you're not offering them a job right off the bat. You should have at least a small amount of back-and-forth before you make a formal offer.

## Interview candidates

When hiring writers, I care most about most is the quality of their published content. It's difficult to learn this by interviewing from an interview. Instead of a lengthy interview process, I keep my interviews short and quickly hire the writer for a paid trial (see [below](#start-a-paid-trial)).

Still, the interview does give you a glimpse into what it's like working with this person. Do the two of you communicate well or does it take several back and forths before a question is sufficiently stated and answered?

| Signs of a <font color="red">bad</font> candidate | Signs of a <font color="green">good</font> candidate |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| They ask questions that you already answered in your invitation letter or job description. | They demonstrate that they've spent time learning about your project. |
| They respond to your personalized invitation with a generic form letter. | They express genuine interest and enthusiasm about the work. |
| Their questions to you are ambiguous or poorly-worded. | Their questions are thoughtful and relevant. |

If I like someone's profile and writing samples, I'll generally hire them even if our interview is mediocre. Interviews are mainly useful for identifying egregiously bad candidates who communicate poorly.

## Start a paid trial

I think the best way to evaluate writing candidates is by hiring them on a trial basis. Talented writers can be put off by a lengthy, unpaid screening process. If you show that you're willing to begin paying them for their work right away, it attracts stronger writers.

Here's an example invitation to a paid trial:

>I don’t do a lengthy interview process because I feel like the best way to see if it’s a good match is to just do a paid trial for a few articles. If that sounds good to you, I’ll send you a freelance contract to e-sign and give you your first article assignment. I’ll send payment via check every two weeks for any hours you’ve worked.

I specifically avoid terms like "probationary period" because it sounds like I'm waiting for the writer to screw up. This is a trial for both of us. It's an opportunity for me to see how the writer produces content for me, and it's a chance for the writer to see what I'm like as a paying client.

A paid trial is part of the candidate search. Many of your trial hires won't last, so you can hire multiple writers in parallel even if you ultimately want only one writer long-term.

## Working with writers

Now that you've hired a writer on a trial basis, it's time to begin working with them and evaluate whether they're the right long-term match for your business.
