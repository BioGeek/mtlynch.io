Obviously, you're not going to hire every writer you find. You need a way to evaluate candidates based on their profile. You don't have much information to go on.

Some guides recommend asking writers to produce a custom sample for you where you buy it if you like it, but "let them keep it" and pay them nothing if it's not what you're looking for. I don't do this, because it violates [my fundamental hiring principle](/hiring-content-writers/#the-fundamental-principle-of-hiring-talented-people). Top-tier writers have no interest in spending hours on an assignment that will only *maybe* pay them.


## Evaluation criteria

### Hourly rate

It's natural to assume that a $60/hr writer is substantially better than a $30/hr writer, but I found this not to be the case. The rate that writers billed seemed unrelated to the quality of their writing. In particular, the best writer I found was also the one who charged the lowest rate ($20/hr).

### Bio

In most places you find a writer, they'll provide a bio explaining the type of writing they should do and why you should hire them.

This is purely the writer talking. They should have a writing portfolio, but it's a bit more obscure. They didn't ge to choose the topics they wrote about and it probably went through revisions from the publisher, for better or for worse. they often don't have control over the topics they write about or their style. The bio is purely theirs, so it's the most pure sample you can get of their writing.

For me, spelling or grammar errors in the bio are an automatic no-hire. If they can't get their grammar correct in their bio, they're never going to get it right in the work they do for me.

Red flags:

* Grammar errors
* Spelling errors
* Convoluted language
* Confusing phrasing

### Writing samples

It's harder to judge quality in the writing samples. If they have a good piece, maybe it's because they wrote garbage and the publication's editor cleaned it up. Conversely, if the article feels boring and convoluted, it could be because the client asked for a 2,000 word article about a topic that should have taken 500 words.

When I read the writing samples, I'm looking for writing that's extremely good or extremely bad. I can reject extremely bad writing. If the writing samples are so-so, I'll reach out to the candidate and say that I'm interested and ask if they have a writing sample that matches what I'm looking for.

### Reviews

Sites like Upwork keep reviews for each freelancer. In my experience, reviews have been the least meaningful indicators of quality. Some of the writers I've hired had dozens of perfect five-star reviews, and then they turned in work that was barely intelligible and riddled with syntax errors.

 I'm not sure if there's fraud happening or if everyone's just a much softer reviewer than I am, but reviews don't seem to correlate with quality. Several writers I hired had perfect five-star ratings from dozens of reviews, and then they turned in work

 I haven't found these to be particularly valuable. There's an unfortunate trend on sites like Upwork where people generally give a perfect score to indicate There are too many low-quality blogs hiring people to produce any English, and they give five-star reviews for all work.

Negative reviews are a stronger signal. If it's just one or two clients who are upset, but their reviews are otherwise good, it's not a big deal. Some clients are just jerks and have unreasonable expectations of freelancers.

## Pitfalls to avoid

### Steer clear of fluff factories

There Internet is experiencing an epidemic of fluff writing. Site owners [think that Google will place their pages higher](https://moz.com/blog/blog-post-length-frequency) in results if they have a higher word count. And writers who get paid by the word try to make their content longer to earn more money per assignment. As a result, instead of learning to write well, many writers have learned to write fluff.

You can recognize fluff if it sounds like you're reading a book report from a fifth grader who forgot to do the reading. Here's an example:

>Fitness is important. We all know this! A recent study found that people who exercise are better than people who don’t. So you don’t have any excuse not to hit the gym and start working on those extra pounds!
>
>But fitness won’t just happen. You have to work for it. The first step is making a commitment that will force you to keep a regular gym habit. It can be a pact with a friend or sessions with a personal trainer. Anything that will keep your butt off the couch!
>
>Don’t overdo it either! Many people start working out and push themselves past their limits and injure themselves. Make sure to know your limits and always stay hydrated.

When you're hiring, avoid "fluff factories," writers who can only write in the form of fluff. Signs of a fluff factory include:

* The writing feels desperate to be interesting with lots of hyperbole, ALL CAPS, and exclamation points.
* There are long stretches of text devoid of useful information or analysis.

### Beware the jack  of all trades

Writing is really hard. The ones who are good at it focus on it exclusively. People who are expert copywriters and WordPress designers are generally not very good at either. If you were searching for someone to perform your brain surgery, how would you feel about a doctor who said, "I'm an expert neurosurgeon and an expert auto mechanic."

### Resist the temptation to "fix" bad writers

One trap I fell into was, "Oh, their writing is rough, but I can probably coach them to improve it." This never worked. 

Writing improves slowly. If they're a professional writer, and they produce D-grade writing, they'll remain a D-grade writer for years to come. Remember that when you see an enthusiastic but mediocre writer offering to work at bargain basement rates.

## Inviting freelancers to apply

You can find higher quality candidates if you reach out proactively. The best candidates are generally not the ones constantly checking job boards for new postings.

When you proactively reach out, take the same steps as if you're evaluating an inbound candidate. Read their bio, check their writing samples. When you reach out to them, mention specifics about why you're interested in speaking with them. Writers get generic spam solicitations all the time, so a personalized invitation instantly makes you stand out as a client who respects their work and is worth speaking to.

Why does the writer want to work for you?

Be clear that you're not offering them a job right off the bat. You want to get a little bit more information from them before you make a formal offer.

## Interviewing candidates

The *real* interview begins I hire the writer. I can't really tell how well we work together and how accurately the freelancer can produce the writing I want until we've worked together on two or three pieces.

When I interview candidates

| Signs of a <font color="red">bad</font> candidate | Signs of a <font color="green">good</font> candidate |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| They ask questions that you already answered in your invitation letter or job description. | They demonstrate that they've spent time learning about your project. |
| They respond to your personalized invitation with a generic form letter. | They express genuine interest and enthusiasm about your project. |
| Their questions to you are ambiguous or poorly-worded.

## Extending offers

You can hire multiple candidates at once.

I try to avoid words that imply like "probationary period." Let's see if it's a good fit.
