You can't judge how well a writer writes for you until they write for you. When they write their first few pieces for you, you're effectively still interviewing them. Pay attention to how well the two of you communicate and how much coaching or editing they need before they produce content that matches what you want.

# Create a contract

When you hire a writer to create content for you, there are several types of agreements you can have. You might license content from them, so they can still use it elsewhere but you have the right to publish it yourself.

Here's a [good template](https://medium.com/@jyssicaschwartz/have-a-free-freelancer-contract-template-4a009f181830) I found.

If you're using a freelancing service, they likely have a default contract. For example, Upwork's [default contract](https://www.upwork.com/legal#optional-service-contract-terms) assigns all intellectual property rights to the client.

# Use a style guide to enforce consistency

[TODO: Link to image](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uy19xtf_PFW0LJ2Zj6cSkH2dhHED8PCjHCtup1_IQ_4/edit#heading=h.qwnjmopyhpr6)

Make it a Google Doc or a wiki where there's a single, authoritative copy of it. If the style guide is in an email or a Word Document, it's hard to update and ensure that everyone's working from the same copy.

You shouldn't try to cover everything in the English language. Just the things that come up frequently for your site. For example, Is It Keto was about the keto diet, so my style guide had detailed instructions on how to format measurements and how to abbreviate words like "carbohydrates" and "ketogenic."

You can create this

Some writers use the term "website" and some use "web site" then your site is messy.

Iterate on the style guide as you go. Instead of just telling someone that they're making a style error, link to the style guide. Don't make it too long or it's hard for people to learn.

Pay writers to learn the style guide. If you show

# Agree on an editing workflow

You've hired a writer and created a style guide. Now, they need to start writing for you. But a lot has to happen between them writing the first draft and you publishing their content.

Here's the editing workflow I used with writers for Is It Keto:

1. I create a Google Doc with the template of an article. (TODO: show example)
1. I share the Google Doc with the writer and ask them to fill in the template.
1. Writer emails me to let me know when they have a draft ready for me to review.
1. I add margin comments to the Google Doc and make inline edits in "Suggesting" mode.
1. I email the writer to let them know when my edits are complete.
1. Repeat steps 3-5 until the article is ready to publish.

There will be bumps. Every workflow is different. I ran into a recurring issue with one of my writers where I'd make an inline edit to improve her phrasing. She'd see it pop up as a suggestion and, rather than accepting the suggestion, she'd revise it to something else. This was frustrating because I was ready to publish the version I suggested and then she changed it to something else I didn't like. Finally, I asked her what she was doing and it turned out that she was afraid I'd think she was lazy if she just took my suggestion and did nothing else.

Minimize the rounds of review. Look for patterns that are coming up and see if you can put these into 

Instance where I would suggest an edit and she would make more edits.

## Start small and easy

When I began hiring freelancers, I assigned them to write three different articles and email me when they were done. And then every time, they made the same mistakes on each article.

Instead, start with just one. The freelancer's first attempts will be bad. You want to pay for that once and not three times.

## Timebox

Limit their time on the first assignment.

## Evaluating their first few drafts

This is where the interview really begins.

* What parts take the most time?

Bad if they make the same mistakes over and over.

Start small and easy and work your way up to harder pieces.

Try to put corrections in your style guide first. Then, send a link. In the likely even that you end up working with another writer, you don't have to go through this process again.

## Giving tactful feedback

You stand out as a client simply by not being a jerk.

## Decide to stick or bail

Jump to the section on [terminating writers](/hiring-content-writers/3-terminating-writers/).

## Meet regularly in person or on video chat

Morgan has a blind spot for passive voice and I have a high sensitivity for it. She would often submit work using the passive voice and it would frustrate me to no end. "Why doesn't she care enough to observe this rule?" But when we met over video chat, it was immediately obvious that she cared deeply about the quality of the work, and the passive voice was just her blind spot. And we all have blind spots for errors in our writing. My [editor](/editor) always criticizes my comma usage but I, don't have, any idea what she's talking, about.

Be open. Ask if there's anything about the workflow that makes it harder for them to do their best work. Is there anything you can do. The worst thing is for your freelancer doing unnecessary work because they mistakenly thought you wanted it that way.

Pay for their time meeting with you.

## Invest in good writers

If you made it this far, congratulations! It's difficult to find good writers. Unless you got extremely lucky, it probably took a lot of time to find them. Now, make sure they'll stick with you.

* I sent *The Elements of Style* (aka *Strunk and White*)

## Pay promptly

See whopayswriters.com. One of the biggest factors in writers' experience with clients is promptness of pay.

## Terminating writers
