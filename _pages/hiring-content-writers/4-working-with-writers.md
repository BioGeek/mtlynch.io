You can't judge how well a writer writes for you until they write for you. When they write their first few pieces for you, you're effectively still interviewing them. Pay attention to how well the two of you communicate and how much coaching or editing they need before they produce content that matches what you want.

## Send a kickoff email

Once I decide to hire a writer on a trial basis, I send them a kickoff email. Below, I've included an actual kickoff email I sent to one of my writers:

>I’ve just sent over the contract for you to sign. Let me know if you have any questions.
>
>Once you sign, you can begin working. The first article I’d like you to write is **Green Beans**. You can put the text in this shared document:
>
>TODO: Link to template document
>
>Here is the site style guide:
>
>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uy19xtf_PFW0LJ2Zj6cSkH2dhHED8PCjHCtup1_IQ_4/edit?usp=sharing
>
>Please bill for time that it takes you to learn the style guide and research the basics of the keto diet. I know there’s a lot in the style guide, so I’m not expecting you to get it perfect on your first try, but do your best to adhere to it.
>
>You can enter your hours in this spreadsheet:
>
>TODO: Link to template timesheet
>
>Limit your time on this first assignment to 5 hours. If you’re approaching 4.5 hours and you’re not finished, take the last half hour to organize the work you have so far and let me know what your progress is. There’s not a ton of urgency on this, but if you could let me know what day to expect the work, that would be helpful.
>
>Can you also send me a mailing address where I should send your checks? I'll send the first one out on Saturday, September 7th for any hours you've worked through 9/6.

The critical things that are happening in this email:

* It clarifies that their work must be **under contract**.
* It provides a **style guide** and lays out my expectations around it.
* It **timeboxes** the assignment so that there are no billing surprises.
* It explains **how they bill their hours**.
* It explains **how I will pay them**.

I describe each of these elements in detail below.

## Create a contract

When you hire a writer, you need a contract to eliminate any ambiguity about the relationship. Can the writer resell the content they give you to other sites or do you have full rights to their work?  To eliminate misunderstandings or legal disputes later on, create a contract that defines the tems of the work.

This is easier than it sounds, as there are freelance writing contracts available online for free. I used [this template](https://www.docracy.com/0vc0u7keb75/work-for-hire-freelance-writing-master-agreement) with some modifications and then used [Docracy](https://www.docracy.com) to send the contract to my writers and collect their e-signatures.

**Sidenote**: I find the Docracy interface buggy and unintuitive. I only mention it because it's the service I used, but if you find a better service, choose that (and tell me about it).
{: .notice--info}

If you hire through a freelancing marketplace, they likely have a default contract that does what you want. For example, Upwork's [default contract](https://www.upwork.com/legal#optional-service-contract-terms) assigns all intellectual property rights to the client, so you wouldn't have to create your own contract.

## Use a style guide to enforce consistency

Do you want the content on your site to be formal and serious? Or do you want it to be irreverent and a little bit silly. Your writers won't know what type of writing you want unless you tell them. Just as importantly, you need content on your site to maintain consistency, even if it includes content from multiple writers. Otherwise, you end up with one article on your site that's sterile and highly scientific, while another is filled with slang and animated gifs.

Your style guide tells your writers what kind of writing you want and what conventions to follow. Here's the style guide for Is It Keto:

[TODO: Add screenshot of style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uy19xtf_PFW0LJ2Zj6cSkH2dhHED8PCjHCtup1_IQ_4/edit#heading=h.qwnjmopyhpr6)

Avoid the temptation to create rules for every situation you can imagine. Limit the style guide to issues that come up frequently for your site. For example, Is It Keto focuses on the keto diet, so my style guide had detailed instructions on how to format food measurements and how to abbreviate words like "carbohydrates" and "ketogenic."

Make it a Google Doc or a wiki where there's a single, authoritative copy of it that's easy to update. If the style guide is trapped in an email or PDF, it's difficult to ensure that everyone's working from the latest version.

Your style guide is a living document, and you should continue updating it as you work with your writers. For example, if you see a writer omitting the [Oxford comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma), but you're an ardent supporter, resist the temptation to simply correct the mistake. Instead, update your style guide to mention that writers should use the Oxford comma, and point the writer to this new section. Be judicious about what you add to the style guide, however. The longer the guide, the harder it is for people to learn it.

I pay my writers to learn the style guide. I find it's helpful for the relationship because it shows them right out of the gate that I respect their time and I'm not a client who's going to pressure them into giving me unpaid work.

## Keep your first assigment small and easy

No matter how good your writer is, there's always a learning curve as they figure out how to write content that matches what you want. You can accelerate their learning by keeping a tight feedback loop. Start them out with small, simple assignments. As they master the easy stuff, gradually progress to larger and more complicated projects.

## Timebox early assignments

If you're paying by the hour, it's critical to timebox your freelancer's work. Otherwise, you might assign them something that you assume will take only 30 minutes, and they come to you two days later with an invoice for 15 hours of work.

Set an explicit limit on the time they should spend on their first assignment. Here's the instruction I give to my new writers:

>Limit your time on this first assignment to 5 hours. If you’re approaching 4.5 hours and still have work remaining, take the last half hour to organize what you have so far and share your progress with me.

As you work together more, you can increase or eliminate this cap on their hours.

## Agree on an editing workflow

You've hired a writer and created a style guide. Now, they need to start writing for you. But a lot has to happen between them writing the first draft and you publishing their content.

Here's the editing workflow I used with writers for Is It Keto:

1. I create a Google Doc with the template of an article. (TODO: show example)
1. I share the Google Doc with the writer and ask them to fill in the template.
1. Writer emails me to let me know when they have a draft ready for me to review.
1. I add margin comments to the Google Doc and make inline edits in "Suggesting" mode.
1. I email the writer to let them know when my edits are complete.
1. Repeat steps 3-5 until the article is ready to publish.

There will be bumps. Every workflow is different. I ran into a recurring issue with one of my writers where I'd make an inline edit to improve her phrasing. She'd see it pop up as a suggestion and, rather than accepting the suggestion, she'd revise it to something else. This was frustrating because I was ready to publish the version I suggested and then she changed it to something else I didn't like. Finally, I asked her what she was doing and it turned out that she was afraid I'd think she was lazy if she just took my suggestion and did nothing else.

Minimize the rounds of review. Look for patterns that are coming up and see if you can put these into 

Instance where I would suggest an edit and she would make more edits.

## Evaluating their first few drafts

This is where the interview really begins.

* What parts take the most time?

Bad if they make the same mistakes over and over.

Start small and easy and work your way up to harder pieces.

Try to put corrections in your style guide first. Then, send a link. In the likely even that you end up working with another writer, you don't have to go through this process again.

## Giving tactful feedback

You stand out as a client simply by not being a jerk.

## Pay promptly

See whopayswriters.com. One of the biggest factors in writers' experience with clients is promptness of pay.

TODO: Timesheet example.

## Decide to stick or bail

Jump to the section on [terminating writers](/hiring-content-writers/3-terminating-writers/).

## Meet regularly in person or on video chat

Morgan has a blind spot for passive voice and I have a high sensitivity for it. She would often submit work using the passive voice and it would frustrate me to no end. "Why doesn't she care enough to observe this rule?" But when we met over video chat, it was immediately obvious that she cared deeply about the quality of the work, and the passive voice was just her blind spot. And we all have blind spots for errors in our writing. My [editor](/editor) always criticizes my comma usage but I, don't have, any idea what she's talking, about.

Be open. Ask if there's anything about the workflow that makes it harder for them to do their best work. Is there anything you can do. The worst thing is for your freelancer doing unnecessary work because they mistakenly thought you wanted it that way.

Pay for their time meeting with you.

## Invest in good writers

If you made it this far, congratulations! It's difficult to find good writers. Unless you got extremely lucky, it probably took a lot of time to find them. Now, make sure they'll stick with you.
