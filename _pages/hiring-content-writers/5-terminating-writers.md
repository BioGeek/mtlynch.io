If you've followed this guide, you've hired writers on a trial basis, which means that many of them won't work out.

## Avoiding a termination

Try not to phrase it in a scary "you're about to get fired way" but like:

>What can I do to help reduce these issues?

## Example termination notes

Here's a real letter I wrote to one of the writers that didn't work out:

>Unfortunately, I need to end the contract here. Your writing is good, but we're on our eighth article, and the style is still fairly distant from what I'd like it to be.
>
>From reading the shrimp and celery articles, it looks like it would require 2-3 rounds of review before I'd feel comfortable publishing it. At that point, it's faster for me to write the reports myself.
>
>I appreciate all your work and wish you the best going forward.

And this one is my harshest:

>That's twice in a row that you promised work by a certain date and didn't deliver or give an update, so I'm afraid I need to end our relationship here.
>
>I mailed you a check on Saturday for your hours. I don't need edits on the remaining articles.
>
>Best of luck in the future.

## Keys to a good termination

* Stick to objective facts
* Focus on the writing rather than the person
* Avoid injecting insults or negative personal feelings about their work

If you're on a platform like Upwork, you especially want to avoid acrimonious terminations because then the client will write you a review that says you're an unreasonable client and you'll make it harder on yourself to hire freelancers in the future.


## Do it all over again

You have to work with a lot of writers to find one that you like. And with each writer you work with, you should get a better sense of what you're looking for and what you want to avoid. Before you begin interviewing again, revise your job description. Think about patterns of error with your last writer. Are there things

In my case, I noticed that I was burning a lot of time fixing grammatical errors for my writers. I thought it was a given that professional writers should use proper grammar, but in fairness, there are plenty of clients who don't care, so writers don't assume that they have to do it. Before seeking more applicants, I adjusted my job description to say that writers needed to use proper grammar. When I had subsequent writers submit content with grammatical errors, it was easier to say, "Hey, a lot of grammar errors are slipping though. Can you use a tool like Grammarly to check your writing before sending it to me?"

* Revise your job description
* Update your "example pieces"
* Re-read your style guide
  * Are there patterns of error that keep coming up that you can cover in your style guide?
