If you've followed this guide, you've hired writers on a trial basis, which means that many of them won't work out.

## Example termination notes

Here's an email I wrote to one of the writers that didn't work out:

>Unfortunately, I need to end the contract here. Your writing is good, but we're on our third article, and the style is still fairly distant from what I'd like it to be.
>
>From reading the celery article, it looks like it would require 2-3 rounds of review before I'd feel comfortable publishing it. At that point, it's faster for me to write the reports myself.
>
>I appreciate all your work and wish you the best going forward.

And this one is my harshest:

>That's twice in a row that you promised work by a certain date and didn't deliver or give an update, so I'm afraid I need to end our relationship here.
>
>I mailed you a check on Saturday for your hours. I don't need edits on the remaining articles.
>
>Best of luck in the future.

I don't claim to be an expert at firing people, but I can say that all of my terminations have gone smoothly. The writers accept my reasons for ending the relationship and have never accused me of acting unfairly.

## Keys to a graceful termination

The rules for artfully ending a relationship are similar to the [rules for giving feedback](/hiring-content-writers/4-working-with-writers/#giving-tactful-feedback):

* Remain objective
* Stick to facts
* Focus on the writing rather than the person
* Avoid injecting insults or negative personal feelings about their work

>**<font color="red">Bad</font>**: Your writing is terrible, and I hate you.

>**<font color="green">Good</font>**: Your writing unfortunately doesn't match the style I'm looking for, and I don't feel that we communicate well.

On a platform like Upwork, it's especially important to avoid acrimonious terminations because writers leave feedback for their clients. If they give you a low rating and accuse you of being an unreasonable client, you'll have a harder time attracting talent in the future.

## Do it all over again

You have to work with a lot of writers to find one that you like. And with each writer you work with, you should get a better sense of what you're looking for and what you want to avoid. Before you begin interviewing again, review your job description and style guide. Think about patterns of error with your last writer. Are there things

As an example from Is It Keto, I was burning a lot of time fixing grammatical errors for my writers. I thought it was a given that professional writers should use proper grammar, but in fairness, there are plenty of clients who don't care, so writers don't assume that they have to do it. Before seeking more applicants, I adjusted my job description to make proper grammar an explicit requirement of the job.

* Revise your job description
  * Are there misunderstandings about the work that you can clarify at this stage?
* Update your example articles
  * Do you have any new articles that can serve as the better model of what you want?
* Re-read your style guide
  * Are there patterns of error that keep coming up that you can cover in your style guide?

It's frustrating to invest hours into a writer only to have to throw it away. On the plus side, each iteration gives you a better sense of what you want, helps you more quickly distinguish between good and bad candidates, and improves your skills as a manager. When you find the writer that matches what you need, it can be a tremendous partnership, but expect to put in a lot of work to find them.
