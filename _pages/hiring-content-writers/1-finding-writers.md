There are thousands of working freelance writers in the world, but if you've never hired one before, you don't know where to find them. In this section, I describe the places where I sought writers with varying levels of success.

## Upwork

Upwork is a marketplace for freelancers (TODO: link). It's always been a klunky, unstable site, and they recently instituted a ridiculous fee hike (TODO: link), but it's the best option if you're hiring writers for the first time.

### Advantages

* There are many writers in one place, so you have to do less searching around.
* Everyone's hourly rate is displayed publicly, so there's less work for the client in price discovery and negotiation.
* Upwork has a built-in escrow service so you're protected from getting ripped off.
  * Their escrow system also notoriously skewed to favor clients over freelancers.
* Upwork handles all tax reporting, so you don't need to collect tax information from your freelancer.
* Upwork's default contract assigns the client the rights to all intellectual property created during the contract.

### Disadvantages

* Upwork collects fees from both the client and freelancer, effectively making it XX% more expensive to hire someone.
* Once you begin working with someone through Upwork, you're contractually bound to pay them exclusively through Upwork (including Upwork fees) for two years.
* Too many clients abuse the escrow system, which has driven many talented writers away from the platform.
* Upwork [fails to eliminate phony freelancers](/upwork-scammer/) from its platform.

Upwork was where I found my best writer, but I did paid trials with seven others before I found her.

## College job boards

College job boards are a hidden gem for hiring content writers. I posted a job listing on the online student job boards for two of my local colleges and here were my results:

| School             | Applications | Trial hires | Permanent hires |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Large state school | 17           | 3           | TBD             |
| Small liberal arts school | 8     | 1           | TBD             |

The quality of candidates is on par with what I've found on Upwork, but the rates are much lower. On Upwork, writers typically charge between $30-75/hr. In my area, typical wages for student jobs are $11-15/hr for things like babysitting or secretarial work. I listed the writing position for Is It Keto at $13/hr, and it's especially appealing to students because it's work they can do from anywhere and set their own hours.

The best candidates had experience writing for college publications. In the future, I may try reviewing college newspapers and reach out to student journalists whose writing I like.

## Personal referrals

The nice thing about writers is that their work is highly visible, so people tend to be aware of the writers in their social and professional networks. The downside is that freelance writing relationships don't often last, so you might generate bad blood if you abruptly fire someone's friend, or worse, your own friend.

I found two writers through personal referrals, but they were among the top in terms of quality. They made the fewest grammatical errors and produced writing that was lively and interesting. They were also among my most expensive hires at $50/hr and $60/hr.

Oddly, they were also the writers that created the most logistical problems. With both of them, there were a high number of miscommunications and missed deadlines. They also seemed to have a more rigid style than other writers. They wrote content that mostly adhered to my style guide, but any mistakes they made, they kept repeating. Upwork writers were better at fixing bad habits after I pointed them out.

## Printed flyers

I live in South Hadley, MA, close to many liberal arts colleges. I thought maybe I could find a talented college student, so I put up flyers in my town and on Mt. Holyoke's campus.

I received only one serious applicant, and their writing samples were just poorly-written school assignments, so we never even got to the point of a paid trial.

## Soliciting from my blog

In December, I published an article about [encountering a phony writer on Upwork](/upwork-scammer/). I thought the piece might attract the attention of other freelance writers, so I included little self-advertisements in the post asking people to email me if they were looking for writing work.

This strategy generated two applications, but neither one was strong enough for me to start a paid trial.

## /r/HireaWriter

A few times throughout my project, I checked [/r/HireaWriter](https://www.reddit.com/r/HireaWriter/). It's a subreddit (community) on the social networking site, Reddit.

None of the writers seeking work seemed promising enough to even invite to an interview. The posts seemed geared toward clients with cheap spam blogs who are looking to pay bottom-of-the-barrel rates for barely-intelligible content.

## Next step: the job description

Once you've found a place to reach out to writing candidates, it's time to write a description of the job that tells candidates what you expect.
