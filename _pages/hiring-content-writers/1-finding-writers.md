The first step in hiring a writer is finding and interviewing them. In this section, I cover:

* Locating freelance writers
* Creating a clear job description
* Screening writers to avoid bad hires

# Where to look

There are thousands of working freelance writers in the world, but if you've never hired one before, you don't know where to find them. In this section, I describe the places where I sought writers with varying levels of success.

### Upwork

Upwork is a marketplace for freelancers that I've written about before (TODO: link). It's always been a klunky, unstable site, and they recently instituted a ridiculous fee hike.

Still, I think Upwork is your best option if you're hiring writers for the first time.

**Advantages**

* There are many writers in one place, so you have to do less searching around.
* Everyone's hourly rate is displayed publicly, so there's less work for the client in price discovery and negotiation.
* Upwork has a built-in escrow service so you're protected from getting ripped off.
  * Their escrow system also notoriously skewed to favor clients over freelancers.
* Upwork handles all tax reporting, so you don't need to collect tax information from your freelancer.
* Upwork's default contract assigns the client the rights to all intellectual property created during the contract.

**Disadvantages**

* Upwork collects fees from both the client and freelancer, effectively making it XX% more expensive to hire someone.
* Once you begin working with someone through Upwork, you're contractually bound to pay them exclusively through Upwork (including Upwork fees) for two years.
* Too many clients abuse the escrow system, which has driven many talented writers away from the platform.
* Upwork [fails to eliminate phony freelancers](/upwork-scammer/) from its platform.

Upwork was where I found my best writer, but I did paid trials with seven others before I found her.

### Personal referrals

The nice thing about writers is that their work is highly visible, so people tend to be aware of the writers in their social or professional networks. Careful to avoid the pitfalls of hiring a personal friend, I asked my writer friends for recommendations of freelance writers available for work.

I only found two writers through personal referrals, but they were among the top in terms of quality. They made the fewest grammatical errors and produced writing that was lively and interesting. They were also among my most expensive hires at $50/hr and $60/hr.

Oddly, they were also the writers that created the most logistical problems. With both of them, there were a high number of miscommunications and missed deadlines. They also seemed to be less flexible than other writers in general. They were good at matching my style guide in their first draft, but any mistakes they made, they kept repeating in future drafts and revisions.

My sample size is only two people, so patterns aren't very meaningful, but I can imagine that more experienced writers tend to be juggling more clients at once, which might explain missing deadlines and them finding it hard to keep matching my particular style guide.

### Printed flyers

I live in South Hadley, MA, which is located close to many liberal arts colleges. I thought maybe I could find a talented college student, so I put up flyers in my town and on Mt. Holyoke's campus.

{% include image.html file="isitketo-flyer.jpg" alt="Is It Keto Job Flyer" max_width="400px" class="img-border" img_link=true fig_caption="Job flyer I made for Is It Keto using a template from Canva" %}

I received only one serious applicant, and their writing samples were just poorly-written school assignments, so we never even got to the point of a paid trial.

Despite the poor results, I feel like I should have put more effort in here and tried additional colleges. It's impractical for most clients to physically put up fliers at high-quality liberal arts schools, so it might provide access to high-quality writers that nobody else is reaching.

### /r/HireaWriter/

A few times throughout my project, I checked the [/r/HireaWriter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HireaWriter/) for possible candidates. None of the writers seeking work seemed promising enough to even invite to an interview. The subreddit seems geared toward clients with cheap spam blogs.

# Copywriters vs. content writers

When you begin searching for writers, you'll find that there are two main categories of writers: **content writers** and **copywriters**.

**Copywriters** write text that compels the reader to perform some action, such as buying a product or subscribing to a newsletter. They write copy for advertisements, product pages, and promotional emails.

**Content writers** write text that informs or entertains. Content writers write articles, blog posts, and books.

For It It Keto, I needed a content writer, so that's why this guide focuses on content writers.

# Create a detailed job description

A clear, concise job description shows candidates that you're an organized professional who puts thought into what they want. It also helps applicants decide if they're a good fit for the job so they can . Lastly, it helps you select candidates. If you write a thorough job description and they ask you questions that make it obvious they haven't read it, that's a good way to filter out bad candidates.

Here are the important things to cover in the job description:

* Overview
   * What kind of content will they write?
   * What is the goal of the content?
     * Attracting attention to a product?
     * Improving search engine rankings?
     * Building a brand?
* Requirements
  * Does the writer need specialized knowledge in a particular field of study?
    * e.g., medical writing, financial writing
  * Should they have particular skills?
    * e.g., writing for SEO, appealing to young professionals
* Timing
  * How many hours per week do you expect them to put in each week?
  * How quickly must the writer complete work after they receive an assignment?
  * Is it important that their working hours overlap with yours?
* Payment
  * What method of payment will you use?
  * How quickly can writers expect payment?
  * Do you need to collect tax information from them?
    * In the US, you'll need to [collect a 1099](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-misc) from any freelancer that you pay more than $600 per year.
* Examples
  * Link to content to serve as the inspiration for what you want.
    * Be specific about what you like about the examples.
  * You can also link to counter-examples of writing you don't like.
    * What aspects of the counter-examples should writers avoid?

I used a Google Doc because it's useful to have a single, authoritative copy that I can update over time. When I found mistakes or wanted to clarify something in the job description, I did in a single place without ever worrying about who has which version of my document.

Here's the job description I used for Is It Keto:

# Save money by offering flexibility

It's tempting to be 

Remember the [fundamental principle of hiring](/hire-a-writer/#the-fundamental-principle-of-hiring-talented-people):

>Talented people are selective about which jobs they take.

Good freelance writers generally juggle multiple clients at once. If you make rigid demands about timing, like they have to be available 24/7. Do you really need them to complete assignments in less than one business day?

For Is It Keto, I explained clearly in the job description that timing was flexible. I expected freelancers to communicate to me when they'd complete assignments, but I was fine waiting a few days until they could fit me in.

# Pay per hour, per word, or per piece?

* Pay per hour: Writer earns an hourly rate regardless of how much content they produce.
* Pay per word: Writer's pay is the final word count of the piece multiplied by an agreed price per word (typically $0.XX to $0.XX).
* Pay per piece: Writer earns a fixed price for each assignment they complete, regardless of length or how long it took to writer.

My philosophy is that I want to attract talented people and pay them for their time. It's my responsibility to use their time most efficiently, so I always choose to pay per hour. I know people 

One very bad reason to avoid paying people per hour is that it's "too expensive." I see a lot of guides tell people that it's too expensive to pay people per hour. This is plainly illogical. If you want work of a particular quality, it's going to cost you roughly the same amount regardless of how you structure the pay. You're not going to trick a writer into producing the same quality work for lower cost.

Another big reason I avoid paying per word is that I wanted concise writing. If I'm paying per word, it encourages writers to include a lot of fluff content that doesn't teach the reader anything.

Other guides criticize hourly wages for the same perverse incentives. They claim that if you pay writers by the hour, they have no incentive to work quickly or produce quality writing. They get paid more if the piece takes longer and requires more revisions, so why would they bother doing a good job? I think this is silly. In my experience, talented people do good work if you allow them to. If you start imposing financial penalties like withholding their pay until they do an unbounded number of unpaid revisions for you, it creates an adversarial relationship between you and your writer.

There are several 

Good writers want to produce good writing

One of my writers told me that she clocks out when she gets up to use the bathroom or get a drink of water and I told her that was crazy.  If someone is producing good work for me, I don't care if they spent an hour writing the article or they took a walk to clear their head for forty minutes, then wrote the article in twenty. In my experience, if you show people that you trust them to do good work and be honest, they'll do it.

# Selecting writers to invite

TODO: Show Morgan Province's profile

Obviously, you're not going to hire every writer you find. You need a way to evaluate candidates based on their profile. You don't have much information to go on.

Some guides recommend asking writers to produce a custom sample for you where you buy it if you like it, but "let them keep it" and pay them nothing if it's not what you're looking for. I don't do this, because it violates my fundamental hiring principle. I think top-tier writers are uninterested in spending hours on an assignment they'd only *maybe* receive payment for.

Writing is really hard. The ones who are good at it focus on it exclusively. People who are expert copywriters and WordPress designers are generally not very good at either. If you were searching for someone to perform your brain surgery, how would you feel about a doctor who said, "I'm an expert neurosurgeon and an expert auto mechanic."

### Hourly rate

It's natural to assume that a $60/hr writer is substantially better than a $30/hr writer, but I found this not to be the case. The rate that writers billed seemed unrelated to the quality of their writing. In particular, the best writer I found was also the one who charged the lowest rate ($20/hr).

### Bio

In most places you find a writer, they'll provide a bio explaining the type of writing they should do and why you should hire them.

This is purely the writer talking. They should have a writing portfolio, but it's a bit more obscure. They didn't ge to choose the topics they wrote about and it probably went through revisions from the publisher, for better or for worse. they often don't have control over the topics they write about or their style. The bio is purely theirs, so it's the most pure sample you can get of their writing.

For me, spelling or grammar errors in the bio are an automatic no-hire. If they can't get their grammar correct in their bio, they're never going to get it right in the work they do for me.

Red flags:

* Grammar errors
* Spelling errors
* Convoluted language
* Confusing phrasing

### Writing samples

It's harder to judge quality in the writing samples. If they have a good piece, maybe it's because they wrote garbage and the publication's editor cleaned it up. Conversely, if the article feels boring and convoluted, it could be because the client asked for a 2,000 word article about a topic that should have taken 500 words.

When I read the writing samples, I'm looking for writing that's extremely good or extremely bad. I can reject extremely bad writing. If the writing samples are so-so, I'll reach out to the candidate and say that I'm interested and ask if they have a writing sample that matches what I'm looking for.

### Reviews

Sites like Upwork keep reviews for each freelancer. In my experience, reviews have been the least meaningful indicators of quality. Some of the writers I've hired had dozens of perfect five-star reviews, and then they turned in work that was barely intelligible and riddled with syntax errors.

 I'm not sure if there's fraud happening or if everyone's just a much softer reviewer than I am, but reviews don't seem to correlate with quality. Several writers I hired had perfect five-star ratings from dozens of reviews, and then they turned in work

 I haven't found these to be particularly valuable. There's an unfortunate trend on sites like Upwork where people generally give a perfect score to indicate There are too many low-quality blogs hiring people to produce any English, and they give five-star reviews for all work.

Negative reviews are a stronger signal. If it's just one or two clients who are upset, but their reviews are otherwise good, it's not a big deal. Some clients are just jerks and have unreasonable expectations of freelancers.

# Steer clear of fluff factories

You'll recognize it if it sounds like you're reading a book report from a fifth grader who forgot to do the reading.

To avoid picking on any candidate, I made up the example below, but it is alarmingly similar to many of the writing samples I saw during hiring:

>Fitness is important. We all know this! A recent study found that people who exercise are better than people who don’t. So you don’t have any excuse not to hit the gym and start working on those extra pounds!
>
>But fitness won’t just happen. You have to work for it. The first step is making a commitment that will force you to keep a regular gym habit. It can be a pact with a friend or sessions with a personal trainer. Anything that will keep your butt off the couch!
>
>Don’t overdo it either! Many people start working out and push themselves past their limits and receive injury. Make sure to know your limits and always stay hydrated.

Signs of a fluff factory:

* The writing feels desperate to be interesting with lots of hyperbole, ALL CAPS, and exclamation points
* There are entire paragraphs that have no information that the average person wouldn't already know

# Resist the temptation to "fix" bad writers

One trap I fell into was, "Oh, their writing is rough, but I can probably coach them to improve it." This never worked. 

Writing improves slowly. If they're a professional writer, and they produce D-grade writing, they'll remain a D-grade writer for years to come. Remember that when you see an enthusiastic but mediocre writer offering to work at bargain basement rates.

# Inviting freelancers to apply

Why does the writer want to work for you?

Invest time in screening. When you invite people to apply, mention specifics about their stuff.

Be clear that you're not offering them a job right off the bat. You want to get a little bit more information from them before you make a formal offer.

# Interviewing candidates

The *real* interview begins I hire the writer. I can't really tell how well we work together and how accurately the freelancer can produce the writing I want until we've worked together on two or three pieces.

When I interview candidates

| Signs of a <font color="red">bad</font> candidate | Signs of a <font color="green">good</font> candidate |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| They ask questions that you already answered in your invitation letter or job description. | They demonstrate that they've spent time learning about your project. |
| They respond to your personalized invitation with a generic form letter. | They express genuine interest and enthusiasm about your project. |
| Their questions to you are ambiguous or poorly-worded.

# Choosing a candidate

You don't need to hire Jane Austen to write for your blog. Unless you're willing to pay $150+ per hour, you're not going to get the cream of the crop no matter how picky you are.

You can hire multiple candidates at once.
