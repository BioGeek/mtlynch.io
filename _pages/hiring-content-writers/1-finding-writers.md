There are thousands of working freelance writers in the world, but if you've never hired one before, you don't know where to find them. In this section, I describe the places where I sought writers with varying levels of success.

## Upwork

[Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/) is a marketplace for freelancers. It's always been a clunky, unstable site, and they recently instituted a [ridiculous fee hike](https://twitter.com/deliberatecoder/status/1140821210906943488), but it's the best option if you're hiring writers for the first time.

### Advantages

* There are many writers in one place, so you have to do less searching around.
* Everyone's hourly rate is displayed publicly, so there's less work for the client in price discovery and negotiation.
* Upwork has a built-in escrow service so you're protected from getting ripped off.
  * In disputes, Upwork generally sides with clients, much to the chagrin of honest freelancers who get stuck with bad clients.
* Upwork manages time-tracking and invoicing, making it simple to pay your freelancer.
* Upwork handles all tax reporting, so you don't need to collect tax information from your freelancer.
* Upwork provides a default contract, so you don't need to draft your own freelancing agreement.

### Disadvantages

* Upwork collects fees from both the client and freelancer, effectively making it ~XX% (TODO: calculate this) more expensive to hire someone.
* Once you begin working with someone through Upwork, you're contractually bound to pay them exclusively through Upwork (including Upwork fees) for two years.
* Upwork attracts cheap, abusive clients, which has caused many talented writers to abandon the platform.
* Upwork [fails to eliminate phony freelancers](/upwork-scammer/) from its system.

Upwork was where I found my best writer, but I did paid trials with seven others before I found her.

## College job boards

College job boards are a hidden gem for hiring content writers. Students in my area return to campus at the end of August, so last month, I posted job listings on the online student job boards for two of my local colleges. Here were my results:

| School             | Applications | Trial hires | Permanent hires |
|--------------------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Large state school | 17           | 3           | TBD             |
| Small liberal arts school | 8     | 1           | TBD             |

The quality of candidates is on par with what I've found on Upwork, but the rates are much lower. On Upwork, writers typically charge between $30-75/hr. In my area, typical wages for student jobs are $11-$15/hr. I listed my job at $13/hr but it's still competitive with other wages when you take into account its flexibility. Students can write articles for me whenever they want from wherever they want, whereas most student employment is babysitting or administrative work, which requires them to appear in a specific place on a rigid schedule.

The best candidates had experience writing for college publications. In the future, I may try reviewing college newspapers and reach out to student journalists whose writing I like.

## Personal referrals

One technique I used was just asking my friends if they knew any freelance writers. I found two writers this way, and they were among the top in terms of quality. They made the fewest grammatical errors and produced writing that was lively and interesting. They were also among my most expensive hires at $50/hr and $60/hr.

Oddly, they were also the writers that created the most logistical problems. With both of them, there were a high number of miscommunications and missed deadlines. They also fared worse at fixing their errors. They wrote content that mostly adhered to my style guide, but any mistakes they made, they kept repeating. Other writers were better at fixing bad habits after I pointed them out.

## Printed flyers

I live in South Hadley, MA, close to many liberal arts colleges. Before I discovered [college job boards](#college-job-boards), I tried putting up flyers on a college campus and around my town.

I received only one serious applicant, and their writing samples were just poorly-written school assignments, so we never even got to the point of a paid trial.

## Soliciting from my blog (content marketing)

In December, I published an article about [encountering a phony writer on Upwork](/upwork-scammer/). I thought the piece might attract the attention of other freelance writers, so I included little self-advertisements in the post asking people to email me if they were looking for writing work.

{% assign fig_caption = "Mini job announcement in my [blog post about a phony freelance writer](/upwork-scammer/)" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="blog-job-listing.jpg" alt="Screenshot of job posting in previous article" max_width="600px" class="img-border" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

This strategy generated two applications, but neither one was strong enough for me to start a paid trial.

## /r/HireaWriter

A few times throughout my project, I checked [/r/HireaWriter](https://www.reddit.com/r/HireaWriter/). It's a community on the social networking site, Reddit.

{% assign fig_caption = "[/r/HireaWriter](https://www.reddit.com/r/HireaWriter/), a Reddit community for hiring freelance writers" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="hireawriter.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the HireaWriter subreddit" max_width="600px" class="img-border" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

None of the writers seeking work seemed promising enough to even invite to an interview. The posts seemed geared toward clients with cheap spam blogs who are looking to pay bottom-of-the-barrel rates for barely-intelligible content.

## Next step: the job description

Once you've found a place to reach out to writing candidates, it's time to write a description of the job that tells candidates what you expect.
