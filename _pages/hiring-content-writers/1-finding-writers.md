The first step in hiring a writer is finding and interviewing them. In this section, I cover:

* Locating freelance writers
* Creating a clear job description
* Screening writers to avoid bad hires

## Where to look

There are thousands of working freelance writers in the world, but if you've never hired one before, you don't know where to find them. In this section, I describe the places where I sought writers with varying levels of success.

### Upwork

Upwork is a marketplace for freelancers that I've written about before (TODO: link). It's always been a klunky, unstable site, and they recently instituted a ridiculous fee hike.

Still, I think Upwork is your best option if you're hiring writers for the first time.

**Advantages**

* There are many writers in one place, so you have to do less searching around.
* Everyone's hourly rate is displayed publicly, so there's less work for the client in price discovery and negotiation.
* Upwork has a built-in escrow service so you're protected from getting ripped off.
  * Their escrow system also notoriously skewed to favor clients over freelancers.
* Upwork handles all tax reporting, so you don't need to collect tax information from your freelancer.
* Upwork's default contract assigns the client the rights to all intellectual property created during the contract.

**Disadvantages**

* Upwork collects fees from both the client and freelancer, effectively making it XX% more expensive to hire someone.
* Once you begin working with someone through Upwork, you're contractually bound to pay them exclusively through Upwork (including Upwork fees) for two years.
* Too many clients abuse the escrow system, which has driven many talented writers away from the platform.
* Upwork [fails to eliminate phony freelancers](/upwork-scammer/) from its platform.

Upwork was where I found my best writer, but I did paid trials with seven others before I found her.

### Personal referrals

The nice thing about writers is that their work is highly visible, so people tend to be aware of the writers in their social or professional networks. Careful to avoid the pitfalls of hiring a personal friend, I asked my writer friends for recommendations of freelance writers available for work.

I only found two writers through personal referrals, but they were among the top in terms of quality. They made the fewest grammatical errors and produced writing that was lively and interesting. They were also among my most expensive hires at $50/hr and $60/hr.

Oddly, they were also the writers that created the most logistical problems. With both of them, there were a high number of miscommunications and missed deadlines. They also seemed to be less flexible than other writers in general. They were good at matching my style guide in their first draft, but any mistakes they made, they kept repeating in future drafts and revisions.

My sample size is only two people, so patterns aren't very meaningful, but I can imagine that more experienced writers tend to be juggling more clients at once, which might explain missing deadlines and them finding it hard to keep matching my particular style guide.

### Printed flyers

I live in South Hadley, MA, which is located close to many liberal arts colleges. I thought maybe I could find a talented college student, so I put up flyers in my town and on Mt. Holyoke's campus.

{% include image.html file="isitketo-flyer.jpg" alt="Is It Keto Job Flyer" max_width="400px" class="img-border" img_link=true fig_caption="Job flyer I made for Is It Keto using a template from Canva" %}

I received only one serious applicant, and their writing samples were just poorly-written school assignments, so we never even got to the point of a paid trial.

Despite the poor results, I feel like I should have put more effort in here and tried additional colleges. It's impractical for most clients to physically put up fliers at high-quality liberal arts schools, so it might provide access to high-quality writers that nobody else is reaching.

### Soliciting from my blog

In December, I published an article about encountering a phony writer on Upwork. I thought the article might attract the attention of other freelance writers, so I included little self-advertisements in the post asking people to email me if they were looking for writing work.

This strategy generated two applications, but neither one was strong enough for me to start a paid trial.

### /r/HireaWriter/

A few times throughout my project, I checked the [/r/HireaWriter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HireaWriter/) for possible candidates. None of the writers seeking work seemed promising enough to even invite to an interview. The subreddit seems geared toward clients with cheap spam blogs.

## Copywriters vs. content writers

When you begin searching for writers, you'll find that there are two main categories of writers: content writers and copywriters.

* **Copywriters** write text that compels the reader to perform some action, such as buying a product or subscribing to a newsletter. They write copy for advertisements, product pages, and promotional emails.
* **Content writers** write text that informs or entertains. Content writers write articles, blog posts, and books.

For It It Keto, I exclusively needed informative articles, so this guide focuses on content writers.

## Create a detailed job description

A clear, concise job description shows candidates that you're an organized professional who puts thought into what they want. It also helps applicants filter themselves from the applicant pool if they're not interested in the writing you want. Lastly, it aids in candidate screening. If you write a thorough job description and they ask you questions that make it obvious they haven't read it, that's a good way to filter out bad candidates.

Here are the important things to cover in the job description:

* Overview
   * What kind of content will they write?
   * What is the goal of the content?
     * Attracting attention to a product?
     * Improving search engine rankings?
     * Building a brand?
* Requirements
  * Does the writer need specialized knowledge in a particular field of study?
    * e.g., medical writing, financial writing
  * Should they have particular skills?
    * e.g., writing for search engine optimization, appealing to young professionals
* Timing
  * How many hours per week do you expect them to work each week?
  * How quickly must the writer complete work after they receive an assignment?
  * Is it important that their working hours overlap with yours?
* Payment
  * What method of payment will you use?
  * How quickly can writers expect payment?
  * Do you need to collect tax information from them?
    * In the US, you'll need to [collect a 1099](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-misc) from any freelancer that you pay more than $600 per year.
* Examples
  * Link to content to serve as the inspiration for what you want.
    * Be specific about what you like about the examples.
  * You can also link to counter-examples of writing you don't like.
    * What aspects of the counter-examples should writers avoid?

I used a Google Doc because it's useful to have a single, authoritative copy that I can update over time. When I found mistakes or wanted to clarify something in the job description, I did in a single place without worrying about who has which version of my document:

## Save money by offering flexibility

Resist the temptation to be overly rigid about timing. It might sound great to have your writers complete assignments within one business day, but that requirement limits the pool of writers and drives rates up.

Think about it from the writers' perspective. If they're juggling several clients at once, what if they receive several assignments that require a one-day turnaround? They either have to pass on jobs that require this or take those jobs only when the pay is extremely high.

Instead, offer writers as much flexibility as you can. You probably can't wait a year, but think about your real timing requirements, not just what sounds ideal. It'll save you money and bring you better candidates.

For Is It Keto, I explained in the job description that timing was flexible. I expected freelancers to communicate to me when they'd complete assignments, but I was fine waiting a few days until they could fit me in.

## Pay per hour, per word, or per piece?

When it comes to pay structure for your freelancers, you have several options:

* **Pay per hour**
  * Writer earns an hourly rate regardless of how much content they produce.
* **Pay per word**
  * Writer's pay is the final word count of the piece multiplied by an agreed price per word (typically $0.XX to $0.XX).
* **Pay per piece**
  * Writer earns a fixed price for each assignment they complete, regardless of length or how long it took to writer.

My philosophy is that I want to attract talented people and pay them for their time. It's my responsibility to use their time most efficiently, so I always choose to pay per hour. I know people 

One very bad reason to avoid paying people per hour is that it's "too expensive." I see a lot of guides tell people to save money by avoiding hourly pay. This is plainly illogical. If you want work of a particular quality, it's going to cost you roughly the same amount regardless of how you structure the pay. You're not going to trick a writer into producing the same quality work for lower costs.

Another big reason I avoid paying per word is that I wanted concise writing. If I'm paying per word, it encourages writers to include a lot of fluff content that doesn't teach the reader anything.

Other guides criticize hourly wages for the same perverse incentives. They claim that if you pay writers by the hour, they have no incentive to work quickly or produce quality writing. They get paid more if the piece takes longer and requires more revisions, so why would they bother doing a good job?

In my experience, talented people deliver quality work if you empower them to do so. If you start micromanaging them or create a system that shifts all financial penalties onto them, the relationship becomes adversarial, and the work suffers.

## Screening writers

By this point, you've hopefully found some sources of writing. Now, it's time to decide which writers to reach out to and how to screen the candidates who apply for your job:
