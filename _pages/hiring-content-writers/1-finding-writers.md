The first step in hiring a writer is finding and interviewing them. In this section, I cover:

* Locating freelance writers
* Creating a clear job description
* Screening writers to avoid bad hires

## Where to look

There are thousands of working freelance writers in the world, but if you've never hired one before, you don't know where to find them. In this section, I describe the places where I sought writers with varying levels of success.

### Upwork

Upwork is a marketplace for freelancers that I've written about before (TODO: link). It's always been a klunky, unstable site, and they recently instituted a ridiculous fee hike.

Still, I think Upwork is your best option if you're hiring writers for the first time.

**Advantages**

* There are many writers in one place, so you have to do less searching around.
* Everyone's hourly rate is displayed publicly, so there's less work for the client in price discovery and negotiation.
* Upwork has a built-in escrow service so you're protected from getting ripped off.
  * Their escrow system also notoriously skewed to favor clients over freelancers.
* Upwork handles all tax reporting, so you don't need to collect tax information from your freelancer.
* Upwork's default contract assigns the client the rights to all intellectual property created during the contract.

**Disadvantages**

* Upwork collects fees from both the client and freelancer, effectively making it XX% more expensive to hire someone.
* Once you begin working with someone through Upwork, you're contractually bound to pay them exclusively through Upwork (including Upwork fees) for two years.
* Too many clients abuse the escrow system, which has driven many talented writers away from the platform.
* Upwork [fails to eliminate phony freelancers](/upwork-scammer/) from its platform.

Upwork was where I found my best writer, but I did paid trials with seven others before I found her.

### Personal referrals

The nice thing about writers is that their work is highly visible, so people tend to be aware of the writers in their social or professional networks. Careful to avoid the pitfalls of hiring a personal friend, I asked my writer friends for recommendations of freelance writers available for work.

I only found two writers through personal referrals, but they were among the top in terms of quality. They made the fewest grammatical errors and produced writing that was lively and interesting. They were also among my most expensive hires at $50/hr and $60/hr.

Oddly, they were also the writers that created the most logistical problems. With both of them, there were a high number of miscommunications and missed deadlines. They also seemed to be less flexible than other writers in general. They were good at matching my style guide in their first draft, but any mistakes they made, they kept repeating in future drafts and revisions.

My sample size is only two people, so patterns aren't very meaningful, but I can imagine that more experienced writers tend to be juggling more clients at once, which might explain missing deadlines and them finding it hard to keep matching my particular style guide.

### Printed flyers

I live in South Hadley, MA, which is located close to many liberal arts colleges. I thought maybe I could find a talented college student, so I put up flyers in my town and on Mt. Holyoke's campus.

I received only one serious applicant, and their writing samples were just poorly-written school assignments, so we never even got to the point of a paid trial.

Despite the poor results, I feel like I should have put more effort in here and tried additional colleges. It's impractical for most clients to physically put up fliers at high-quality liberal arts schools, so it might provide access to high-quality writers that nobody else is reaching.

### Soliciting from my blog

In December, I published an article about encountering a phony writer on Upwork. I thought the article might attract the attention of other freelance writers, so I included little self-advertisements in the post asking people to email me if they were looking for writing work.

This strategy generated two applications, but neither one was strong enough for me to start a paid trial.

### /r/HireaWriter/

A few times throughout my project, I checked the [/r/HireaWriter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HireaWriter/) for possible candidates. None of the writers seeking work seemed promising enough to even invite to an interview. The subreddit seems geared toward clients with cheap spam blogs.

## Copywriters vs. content writers

When you begin searching for writers, you'll find that there are two main categories of writers: content writers and copywriters.

* **Copywriters** write text that compels the reader to perform some action, such as buying a product or subscribing to a newsletter. They write copy for advertisements, product pages, and promotional emails.
* **Content writers** write text that informs or entertains. Content writers write articles, blog posts, and books.

For It It Keto, I exclusively needed informative articles, so this guide focuses on content writers.
