A clear, concise job description shows candidates that you're an organized professional who puts thought into what they want. It also allows the writers to skip applying if they recognize they're a poor match for the work you need. Lastly, it aids you in screening out poor candidates. If an applicant asks you questions that you answered clearly in your job descripion, they're usually a desperate writer blasting out generic applications to any job they see.

## Example job description

I used a Google Doc because it's useful to have a single, authoritative copy that I can update over time. When I found mistakes or wanted to clarify something in the job description, I did in a single place without worrying about who has which version of my document:

[TODO: Add screenshot of Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sPkmViKqOc9GXhkiL7UUcR315H68YYWGDgKn-r4BKJE/edit#)

## Elements of a good job description

Here are the important things to cover in the job description:

* Overview
   * What kind of content will they write?
   * What is the goal of the content?
     * Attracting attention to a product?
     * Improving search engine rankings?
     * Building a brand?
* Requirements
  * Does the writer need specialized knowledge in a particular field of study?
    * e.g., medical writing, financial writing
  * Should they have particular skills?
    * e.g., writing for search engine optimization, appealing to young professionals
* Timing
  * How many hours per week do you expect them to work each week?
  * How quickly must the writer complete work after they receive an assignment?
  * Is it important that their working hours overlap with yours?
* Payment
  * What method of payment will you use?
  * How quickly can writers expect payment?
  * Do you need to collect tax information from them?
    * In the US, you'll need to [collect a 1099](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-misc) from any freelancer that you pay more than $600 per year, though this might not be necessary if you're paying them through a marketplace like Upwork.
* Examples
  * Link to content to serve as the inspiration for what you want.
    * Be specific about what you like about the examples.
  * You can also link to counter-examples of writing you don't like.
    * What aspects of the counter-examples should writers avoid?

## Save money by offering flexibility

Resist the temptation to demand constant availability and quick turnaround. Sure, it sounds great to have a writer at your beck and call, but that requirement limits the pool of writers and drives up their rates.

Think about it from the writers' perspective. Freelancers juggle several clients at once. It's impossible to provide constant availability to all of them, so they either have to pass on jobs that require quick turnaround or take those jobs only when the pay is extremely high.

Instead, offer writers as much flexibility as you can. Instead of imagining your ideal timing requirements, think about what you can live with. Can you tolerate a turnaround time of a week or more on assignments? If so, you'll save money and attract better candidates if you offer this flexibility.

## Pay per hour, per word, or per piece?

When it comes to pay structure for your freelancers, you have several options:

* **Pay per hour**
  * Writer earns an hourly rate regardless of how much content they produce.
* **Pay per word**
  * Writer's pay is the final word count of the piece multiplied by an agreed price per word (typically [$0.10 to $0.75 per word](http://whopayswriters.com)).
* **Pay per piece**
  * Writer earns a fixed price for each assignment they complete, regardless of word count or hours invested.

My strategy is to attract talented people and pay them for their time. It's my responsibility to use their time most efficiently, so I always choose to pay per hour.

Other hiring guides discourage clients from paying people per hour because it's "too expensive." This is plainly illogical. If you want work of a particular quality, it costs the same amount regardless of how you structure the pay. You're not going to trick a writer into producing the same quality work for lower costs.

Another big reason I avoid paying per word is that I want concise writing. If I'm paying per word, it incentivizes writers to include a lot of fluff content that doesn't teach the reader anything.

Other guides criticize hourly wages for the same perverse incentives. They claim that if you pay writers by the hour, they have no incentive to work quickly or produce quality writing. They get paid more if the piece takes longer and requires more revisions, so why would they bother doing a good job?

In my experience, talented people deliver quality work if you empower them to do so. If you start micromanaging them or create a system that shifts all financial penalties onto them, the relationship becomes adversarial, and the work suffers.

## Screening writers

By this point, you've created a job description and shown it to potential writers. Now, it's time to decide how to screen the candidates who apply for your job:
