A clear, concise job description shows candidates that you're an organized professional who puts thought into what they want. It also allows the writers to skip applying if they recognize they're a poor match for the work you need. Lastly, it aids you in screening out poor candidates. If an applicant asks you questions that you answered clearly in your job description, they're usually a desperate writer blasting out generic applications to any job they see.

## Example job description

Below, I've included the job description I use to hire writers for Is It Keto. I used a Google Doc because it's useful to have a single, authoritative copy that I can update over time. When I found mistakes or wanted to clarify something in the job description, I did in a single place without worrying about who has which version of my document:

{% assign fig_caption = "Is It Keto's [job description Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sPkmViKqOc9GXhkiL7UUcR315H68YYWGDgKn-r4BKJE/edit#)" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="job-description.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Is It Keto's job description" max_width="825px" class="img-border" link_url="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sPkmViKqOc9GXhkiL7UUcR315H68YYWGDgKn-r4BKJE/edit#" fig_caption=fig_caption %}

## Elements of a good job description

Here are the important things to cover in the job description:

* Overview
   * What kind of content will they write?
   * What is the goal of the content?
     * Attracting attention to a product?
     * Improving search engine rankings?
     * Building a brand?
* Requirements
  * Does the writer need specialized knowledge in a particular field of study?
    * e.g., medical writing, financial writing
  * Should they have particular skills?
    * e.g., writing for search engine optimization, appealing to young professionals
* Assignment details
  * What is the typical word count for your assignments?
  * Are they required to revise the piece based on your feedback?
  * How will they collaborate with you?
    * Google Docs? Word?
  * Will you assign article topics or does the writer pitch ideas to you?
* Attribution and rights
  * Do you keep full rights to the articles or can the writer republish them on other sites?
  * Does the writer receive a byline?
    * e.g., "by Michael Lynch"
  * Is the author allowed to link to their own website?
* Timing
  * How many hours per week do you expect the writer to work each week?
  * How quickly must the writer complete work after they receive an assignment?
  * Is it important that their working hours overlap with yours?
* Payment
  * How do you [structure payment](#pay-per-hour-per-word-or-per-piece)?
  * What method of payment will you use?
    * Check? PayPal? Venmo?
  * How quickly can writers expect payment?
  * Do you need to collect tax information from them?
    * In the US, you'll need to [collect a 1099](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-misc) from any freelancer that you pay more than $600 per year, though this might not be necessary if you're paying them through a marketplace like Upwork.
  * Will you pay a kill fee if you decide not to publish the writer's work?
    * Publishers sometimes pay a "kill fee" if a writer completes an assignment but the publisher doesn't use it.
* Example articles
  * Link to content to serve as the inspiration for what you want.
    * Be specific about what you like about the examples.
  * You can also link to counter-examples of writing you don't like.
    * What aspects of the counter-examples should writers avoid?

## Save money by offering flexibility

Resist the temptation to demand constant availability and quick turnaround. Sure, it sounds great to have a writer at your beck and call, but that requirement limits the pool of writers and drives up their rates.

Think about it from the writers' perspective. Freelancers juggle several clients at once. It's impossible to provide constant availability to all of them, so they either have to pass on jobs that require quick turnaround or take those jobs only when the pay is extremely high.

Instead, offer writers as much flexibility as you can. Instead of imagining your ideal timing requirements, think about what you can live with. Can you tolerate a turnaround time of a week or more on assignments? If so, you'll save money and attract better candidates if you offer this flexibility.

## Pay per hour, per word, or per article?

When it comes to pay structure for your freelancers, you have several options:

* **Pay per hour**
  * Writer earns an hourly rate regardless of how much content they produce.
* **Pay per word**
  * Writer's pay is the final word count of the piece multiplied by an agreed price per word (typically [$0.10 to $0.75 per word](http://whopayswriters.com)).
* **Pay per article**
  * Writer earns a fixed price for each assignment they complete, regardless of word count or hours invested.

TODO: Talk about how pay per article is most common.

My strategy is to attract talented people and pay them for their time. It's my responsibility to use their time most efficiently, so I always choose to pay per hour.

Other hiring guides discourage clients from paying people per hour because it's "too expensive." This is plainly illogical. If you want work of a particular quality, it costs the same amount regardless of how you structure the pay. You're not going to trick a writer into producing the same quality work for lower costs.

Another big reason I avoid paying per word is that I want concise writing. If I'm paying per word, it incentivizes writers to include [fluff content](/hiring-content-writers/3-screening-candidates/#steer-clear-of-fluff-factories) that doesn't teach the reader anything.

Other guides criticize hourly wages for the same perverse incentives. They claim that if you pay writers by the hour, they have no incentive to work quickly or produce quality writing. They earn more if the piece takes longer and requires more revisions, so why would they bother doing a good job?

In my experience, talented people deliver quality work if you empower them to do so. If you start micromanaging them or create a system that shifts all financial penalties onto them, the relationship becomes adversarial, and the work suffers.

## How much should you pay?

Which writer costs more in the long run?

* A writer who charges $30/hr
* A writer who charges $40/hr

**Answer**: Not enough information.

To understand why, you have to consider the total cost of producing an article, which is given by the formula below:

```text
Cost per article = (Freelancer's time writing the article * freelancer's wage) +
                   (Your time editing article * value of your time)
```

TODO: Replace with prettier formula

For example, in February, I [calculated](/retrospectives/2019/03/#diving-into-my-content-costs) that each article took my writer about 2.3 hours to write took me around 37.5 minutes to edit. I paid the writer $20/hr and I valued my own time at $30/hr, so the total cost for each article would be:

```text
Cost per article = (2.3 hours * $20/hr) + (0.625 hours * $30/hr) = $64.75
```

There are two major variables in this equation that you

TODO: Finish this thought

| Candidate source   | What I paid |
|--------------------|-------------|
| [College job boards](/hiring-content-writers/1-finding-writers/#college-job-boards) | $13-$15/hr  |
| [Upwork](/hiring-content-writers/1-finding-writers/#upwork)             | $20-$65/hr  |
| [Personal referrals](/hiring-content-writers/1-finding-writers/#personal-referrals) | $50-60/hr   |
