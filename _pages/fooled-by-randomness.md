* My rating: **5** / 10

This is probably a book that was groundbreaking in 2004, but its ideas have permeated into the mainstream now. Reading it in 2018, the ideas don't feel novel or original.
[*Thinking Fast and Slow*](https://amzn.to/2oXDdaZ) covers the same material with more depth and better writing.

# What I Liked

* Contains many interesting examples of ways people typically derive meaning from random noise or misapply statistics:
  * e.g., [Bayes' Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) as [applied to medical testing](http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/BS/BS704_Probability/BS704_Probability6.html)

# What I Disliked

* The most smug book I've ever read. The superior, mocking attitude is so heavy it almost drips from the pages.
* Wastes so many pages mocking financial authors and TV personalities.
* The author makes a specific point in the preface about how he eschewed advice of editors and felt validated by the sales of his book, but I noticed many instances that could be improved with editing. I felt like the book succeeded despite editing.

# Key Takeaways

* Sampling rate has a strong effect on satisfaction with an investment strategy.
  * People feel the pain of loss more acutely than the joy of gain.
  * Even a profitable investment strategy has periods of losing money due to random fluctuations in the market.
  * A person will be overall less happy with their investment strategy if they check it obsessively because they'll observe many losses and gains due to random fluctuations, but the losses will feel more severe than gains.
* TODO: Theory that humans haven't evolved to properly weigh uncertainty
* When people talk about life expectancy being 73 (or whatever age), that's the *unconditional* life expectancy *at birth*.
  * This number is based on the average of the entire population.
  * As a person ages, their life expectancy increases based on the fact that they haven't died.
  * A 35 year-old's life expectancy is the average lifespan of everyone who survived to at least age 35, not the average lifespan of anyone who was ever born.
* Nassim Taleb would like you to know that Nassim Taleb is intelligent.
