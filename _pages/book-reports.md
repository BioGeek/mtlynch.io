Given how much urban design affects our lives, it's surprising how little we think about it and how little input we have into it. This book was eye-opening in terms of the way I think about cities and how its citizens interact with them. I took for granted the idea that cities should be friendly to car-travel, but the book highlights many ways in which a focus on making cities car-friendly makes them worse for everyone. It was interesting to see how many benefits come from designing cities to prioritize pedestrian and bicycle transit over cars.

This is probably a book that was groundbreaking in 2004, but its ideas have permeated into the mainstream now. In 2018, the ideas don't feel novel or original. [*Thinking Fast and Slow*](https://amzn.to/2oXDdaZ) covers the same material with more depth and better writing.
