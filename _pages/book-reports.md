I try to read as much as possible. This is a way for me to share what I've been reading and forces me to think more deliberately about what I take from each book. Derek Sivers' [keeps public book notes](https://sivers.org/book) provided strong inspiration for these reports.

Given how much urban design affects our lives, it's surprising how little we think about and participate in it. This book was eye-opening in terms of the way I look at cities and how its inhabitants interact with them.

I took for granted the idea that cities should be friendly to car-travel, but the book highlights many ways in which a focus on car-friendliness makes cities worse overall. It was interesting to see examples of how cities can flourish when they prioritize the needs of pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transit.

The book contains many interesting examples of common biases and logical fallacies but it's buried in a lot of bluster and fluff about how smart the author is. While it was likely groundbreaking when it was published in 2004, its ideas have since permeated into the mainstream. Reading it in 2018, the ideas don't feel novel or original. [*Thinking Fast and Slow*](https://amzn.to/2oXDdaZ) covers the same material with more depth and better writing.
