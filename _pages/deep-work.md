# Key Takeaways

* "Deep work" is work accomplished under heavy focus and without distraction.
  * This is in contrast to "shallow work" you could do while distracted (e.g., using Twitter, responding to email)
* Lasting accomplishments are generally the result of deep work, not shallow work
  * e.g., publishing a great book, reaching a non-obvious insight
* Because of the difficulty of measuring performance of knowledge workers, managers tend to equate visible signs of business with high output (e.g., responding quickly to emails, spending lots of time around co-workers).
  * This leads workers to pursue shallow work in order to *appear* productive.
  * People who resist these temptations and pursue deep work can outperform those who focus only on appearing productive.
