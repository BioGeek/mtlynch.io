* My rating: **8** / 10

This book had a profound impact on the way I approach my work and organize my time. After reading it, I find myself much more productive and in control of my time. It was the final push that allowed me to conquer my addiction to social media.

# What I Liked

* TODO

# What I Disliked

* A bit too heavy on fluffy stories about highly accomplished people who achieved greatness due to their commitment to deep work techniques.

# Key Takeaways

* "Deep work" is work accomplished under heavy focus and without distraction.
  * This is in contrast to "shallow work" you could do while distracted (e.g., using Twitter, responding to email)
* Lasting accomplishments are generally the result of deep work, not shallow work
  * e.g., publishing a great book, reaching a non-obvious insight
* Because of the difficulty of measuring performance of knowledge workers, managers tend to equate visible signs of business with high output (e.g., responding quickly to emails, spending lots of time around co-workers).
  * This leads workers to pursue shallow work in order to *appear* productive.
  * People who resist these temptations and pursue deep work can outperform those who focus only on appearing productive.
* TODO: Talk about day scheduler.
