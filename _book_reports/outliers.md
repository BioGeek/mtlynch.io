## What I Liked

* Gladwell writes with an engaging, easy-to-read style.
* Many of the case studies are interesting.
  * Fascinating exploration of the connection between plane crashes and status differential between pilots and their first officers.

## What I Disliked

* Gladwell's overarching theories to tie together all of the case studies felt flimsy and unconvincing.
  * *See also: every other Malcolm Gladwell book ever.*
  * He basically argues that Asian Americans outperform other ethnic groups academically because rice is harder to grow than Western crops, so Asians have a cultural tolerance for hard work.
* Some of his conclusions feel outright illogical.
  * If our selection systems for junior hockey leagues were less biased, we'd have twice as many elite hockey players?

## Key Takeaways

### Self-fulfilling prophecy and relative age

* Elite junior hockey players in Canada are skewed such that most top players have birthdays that fall in January, February, or March.
* In Little Leauge, the age cutoff for the year is Jan. 1.
* Children born early are more developed than those born later in the year.
  * e.g., If you have tryouts on Jan. 1, 2019 for kids born in 2014, the kid who was born Jan 1, 2015 is 5 years old, whereas the kid born Dec. 31st only turned 4 the previous day. The Jan. 1 kid is 25% older and more developed.
* Early in their career, early birthday kids perform better. As a result, more competitive leagues accept them, and coaches give them more attention and specialized training.
  * All of these things amplify these differences in ability so that they persist even when the age difference becomes less significant.
* Skews due to relative age depend on three preconditions:
  * **selection**: groups are selected for skill at a young age
  * **streaming**: after selection, players are separated into independent streams
  * **differentiated experience**: members of the elite group receive more practice time and instruction than others.
* Also known as [The Matthew Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect).

### Exceptionalism and opportunity

* Exceptionally successful people have talent and drive, but they're often born in circumstances that allow them to capitalize on rare opportunities.
* Of the 75 [richest people in history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wealthiest_historical_figures), 14 were born in the US within 9 years of each other (1831-1839).
  * The industrial revolution took place in the 1860s-1870s, so men born in the 1830s were poised to capitalize on it by the 1860s as young men launching new businesses.
* A disproportionate number of modern tech giants were born between 1953-1956.
  * The digital revolution happened in the 1970s, so people born in the 50s were the youn entrepreneurs best positioned to capitalize on it.
    * [Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates) (Microsoft): born 1955
    * [Paul Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Allen) (Microsoft): born 1955
    * [Steve Ballmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ballmer) (Microsoft): born 1956
    * [Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs) (Apple): born 1955
    * [Eric Schmidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt) (Google): born 1955
    * [Bill Joy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy) (Sun Microsystems): born 1954
    * [Scott McNealy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McNealy) (Sun Microsystems): born 1954
    * [Vinod Khosla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Khosla) (Sun Microsystems): born 1955
    * [Andy Bechtolsheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Bechtolsheim)  (Sun Microsystems): born 1955

### IQ and achievement

* IQ in life success is like height in basketball,
  * You need to be at least 6'1 to have a reasonable shot at the NBA, but 6'8 players are not substantially better than 6'2 players.
  * Similarly, your IQ needs to be above a certain threshold to achieve exceptional success, but above that threshold, it's not a good predictor of success.
* [Terman's Termites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_Studies_of_Genius)
  * Lewis Terman conducted a long study whre he selected 1,470 children with the highest IQs among a pool of 250k tested.
  * When they reached adulthood, none of the people in the group achieved exceptional succcess. They performed about the same as a random sample of children.
  * Two children that Terman rejected later went on to win Nobel prices.
* Nobel laureates tend ot graduate from pretty good undergraduate colleges, but they don't come exclusively from top-tier schools like Harvard or MIT.

### The rise of Jewish lawyers in the 1970s

* Jewish lawyers achieved exceptional success in the 1970s because established law firms didn't handle hostile takeovers.
* Prior to the 1970s and the rise of private equity, business leaders avoided hostile takeovers because they were considered "ungentlemanly."
  * Business was an old boys' club, so executives didn't want to take over their friend's business.
* Elite firms excluded Jews, so when someone needed laywers to handle hostile takeovers, they used Jewish law firms.
* From mid-70s to late 80s, money involved in mergers and acquisitions deals increased 2,000% per year, peaking at $250B.
* The lawyers who benefitted most from the rise in hostile takeovers were disproportionately Jewish because they had the most experience with hostile takeovers.

### "Honor culture" of the South

* Dov Cohen and Richard Nesbitt ran [a series of studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8656339) on college students that found that when they insulted the test subjects, Southerners were more likely to suggest violent solutions to a hypothetical scenario, whereas Northerners were unaffected.
* Gladwell suggests that this is related to the fact that Southerners historically raised more livestock, whereas Northerners grew more crops.
  * Livestock is easier to steal, so livestock farmers need to build a reputation as vengeful and strong to discourage theft.
  * Generally, this type of culture is called a "culture of honor."
