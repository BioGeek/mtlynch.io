## What I Liked

* Provides a practical, well-reasoned methodology for interviewing customers
  * Lots of examples of good questions, bad questions, and the rationale behind them
* Beyond what to say to customers, the book recommends a process for arranging those conversations and maximizing what you learn from them
* Quick read &mdash; you can finish it in two or three sittings
* Appreciated the guidance about requesting interviews from customers in a way that is sincere and offers value to the interviewee
* The focus is on casual conversations, and the book has the tone of a friend giving you advice

## What I Disliked

* At a time when inclusiveness in tech is front-of-mind, this book feels tone-deaf when it comes to gender.
  * The book's title relies on stereotypes about mothers being too kind to give their children honest, critical feedback.
  * There are 60+ people mentioned in this book between real-life business leaders (e.g., Elon Musk, Steve Blank), hypothetical customers and entreprenuers, and associates from the author's personal history. Of these, only four are women:
    1. The titular mom of a hypothetical entrepreneur who is featured heavily in example conversations
    1. A woman the author met at a party (she speaks half a sentence)
    1. An entrepreneur who sold nutritional supplements but never speaks in the book
    1. A waitress who does not speak in the book and only appears so that the author can order her to summon her (male) manager
  * In every example conversation, the author refers to the speakers as either "he" or "they," never "she."
* Some of the techniques feel hard or awkward to put into practice when working with real customers.
  * To be fair, sales sometimes feels awkward and unnatural to me, so maybe I'm reacting to that.
* Feels a bit Silicon Valley-centric in that it assumes it's easy to meet your customers in person or run into them coincidentally during your daily routine
* Recommends arranging customer interviews under false pretenses, such as pretending that you're writing a book or PhD thesis

## Key Takeaways

* People tend to lie to founders about their business ideas
  * It's uncomfortable to hurt people's feelings, so there's a bias toward providing pleasing answers
* **The Mom Test**
  * Rules for asking constructive questions during customer interviews so that potential customers give you useful information instead of trying to please you.
  * Named "The Mom Test" because these questions would elicit useful information even from an overprotective mother who wants to shield her child from hurt feelings.
  * Rules for passing The Mom Test:
    >1. Talk about their life instead of your idea.
    >1. Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future.
    >1. Talk less and listen more.
* **Don't** ask the customer whether they'd hypothetically use your product.
  * **Do** ask how they currently address the problem your product solves.
  * **Do** ask what alternative solutions they've investigated.
    * >If they haven't looked for ways of solving it already, they're not going to look for (or buy) yours.
  * People are often overly optimistic about paying for a product in the abstract, when they're much less likely to purchase it in practice.
* **Don't** ask the customer how much they'd pay for a product that solves problem X.
  * **Do** ask how much problem X currently costs them.
* Other good questions:
  * > Who else should I talk to?
  * > Is there anything else I should have asked?
* Compliments from the customer are a bad sign.
  * Compliments cost nothing, so it's a cheap way for the customer to make the founder feel good without making any real commitment.
  * Even sincere compliments are undesirable because the focus should be on the customer's workflow and not your product idea.
  * >Compliments are the fool's gold of customer learning: shiny, distracting, and worthless.
* Avoid fluff
  * > Fluff comes in 3 cuddly shapes:
    > * Generic claims ("I usually", "I always", "I never")
    > * Future-tense promises ("I would", "I will")
    > * Hypothetical maybes ("I might", "I could")
  * When customers drift into fluff, anchor the conversation to concrete details, such as a specific time they solved the problem in question.
* **Don't** accept customer ideas and feature requests at face value
  * **Do** probe to understand the motivation behind the idea.
  * Example
    * Author built a product for a large enterprise customer.
    * The customer asked for analytics, so the author built a flexible analytics dashboard.
    * Then, customer asked for a CSV export, then PDFs of the dashboard.
    * It turned out that the customer just wanted pretty charts to show their own clients each week and they didn't need the customizable dashboard at all.
* **Don't** pitch your product during customer interviews.
  * >Once you start talking about your idea, they stop talking about their problems.
* Focus on asking questions that give you the most information about how to proceed.
  * >If you get an unexpected answer to a question and it doesn't affect what you're doing, it probably wasn't a terribly important question to begin with.
* Negative feedback is valuable.
  * It protects you from investing too deeply in a product that customers are not excited about.
