# What I Liked

* Story is well-written and engaging
* Interesting to see such a revealing view inside Faceboook
* Does an excellent job of explaining technology and finance topics in simple terms and weaving the information into the story

# What I Disliked

* I found the author pretentious and abrasive
  * He boasts about getting out of a ticket after being pulled over for drunk driving.
  * "I got down to the serious business... of trying to bang my product marketing manager [his Facebook colleague]."
  * He seems proud of the fact that he was so dedicated to his startup that he neglected his responsibilities in raising his children.
  * He spends several paragraphs explaining why his tastes are too sophisticated to be impressed when Lady Gaga shows up in his office.
* Author took part in plans to monetize user data and is irritatingly dismissive about the implications on user privacy
  * Paints what feels like a disingenuous representation of Facebook as brave guardians of user data. He claims that *advertisers* are the ones that are the real bad guys as far as privacy.
* Lots of "hustle worship."
  * He sneeringly declines a job offer from Twitter because they encourage their employees to go home at dinnertime, whereas Facebook encouraged all-night hackathons and weekend work.


# Key Takeaways

* You can understand credit default swaps by thinking of them in terms of car insurance
  * Credit default swaps are insurance against someone failing to pay you money they owe. If you buy a bond from someone and it defaults, the seller of a credit default swap will reimburse your losses. Similar to how if your car gets damaged, the insurer will pay for you to get it back to normal state.
  * The difference with credit default swaps is that anyone can buy the policy, so it would be like if your neighbor could buy an insurance policy and collect money if your car got damaged.
  * Further, with credit default swaps, anyone can *sell* a policy, so it would be like if a person across town could sell an insurance policy for your car.
