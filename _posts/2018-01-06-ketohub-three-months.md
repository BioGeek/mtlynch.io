In early October, I debuted KetoHub



# Finding users on Facebook

The largest source of new users has been Facebook. In December, KetoHub had 1,372 new users and 717 (52%) came from Facebook.

And then this other strategy:

# Biggest challenge: Retention

Trading an hour on Facebook for 100 new users sounds great! Especially since I could probably outsource the task for about $20 per day, which would mean I'm paying roughly $0.20 per click. The problem is that I'm losing users as quickly as I gain them.

The chart below is a cohort analysis from Google Analytics. Each row is a group of users that first visited the site in a particular week. Each column  shows the percentage that returned to KetoHub in a subsequent week.

The numbers are abysmal. A small percentage of users will stick around the week after they discover the site, but . From what I've heard, healthy retention after the first week should be above 10%, so this is my biggest challenge right now.

# Next steps

* Conduct more user interviews
  * When I initially launched, I had keto-dieting friends speak to me on the phone as they tried the site for the first time. I used their feedback to improve the site, but now I want to focus on retention. I'll be conducting interviews with strangers who follow keto, then doing a follow up interview a week later to find out why they did or did not continue using KetoHub after the first day.
* Read [*Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products*](http://amzn.to/2EZLzFZ) by Nir Eyal
  * I listened to [his interview](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/023-nir-eyal-of-hooked) on the Indie Hackers podcast last year and found him insightful. I'm hoping the book will give me ideas for improving retention.
* Set up better event tracking analytics
  * I'd like to build a better understanding of how visitors use KetoHub. I'm currently using Google Analytics, which is nice, but not very powerful. I'd like to ask questions like, "Of users who return every week, how often do they filter by category? How often do they search?" I've heard good things about [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/), and I fit in their free tier, so I'll check them out.
