When I worked at Google, my manager worked at the main campus in Mountain View, while I was 3,000 miles away in the NYC office. We met over videochat once every two weeks for a 30-minute "one-on-one." We didn't waste any time in these meetings going over status because my manager had already read my weekly Snippets. This freed us up to discuss things more appropriate to a meeting like strategies for my career growth or areas of my project where I was trying to figure out something complex.

Snippets are a Google-internal tool for sharing status updates. They were nothing complicated, just a text box where you wrote down what you did for the week. Your manager and teammates could subscribe to your snippets and receive an email every Tuesday morning with your Snippets for the previous week.

# You've been writing status updates?

Two years in, I got a new manager whose desk was a few feet away from mine. Accustomed to having managers be up to speed on my status at the start of our one-on-ones, I was confused that my new manager wanted me to explain what I did for the week.

It soon became clear that New Manager did not read my weekly status updates. I thought, "Oh, why am I wasting my time with these?" So I stopped writing them.

After two weeks, I realized that I missed the ritual. Without detaching a bit to reflect on what I did during the week, it was too easy for the job to just feel like this endless stream of meaningless tasks.

Snippets were also good for correcting memory. I'd often end the week feeling like I wasted the week fixing some dumb bug. To write my Snippets, I'd read my outgoing email, review my code changes, and look at my calendar. Whenever I did this, I realized I actually got way more done than I realized. The bug took two days but it *felt* like it sucked up the entire week.

It was also the best way I've seen for sharing status with teammates. If I send them an email every week, that feels pushy and maybe not everyone wants to read it, so I'm putting it on them to handle that email. With Snippets, people could opt-in if they were interested, or read them as needed.

# I miss that textbox

When I [quit Google](/why-i-quit-google/), I lost access to the Snippets tool. Within a few weeks, I realized I really missed it. I looked for alternatives but couldn't find anything similar. A former intern published an open-source reimplementation, but it was buggy and hard to use.

There are tons of tools for status sharing, but they all focus on the manager rather than the employee. They all assume that the employee doesn't want to share their status, so the manager has to force something into their workflow to force them to say what they did.

I liked Snippets for being employee-focused. It was just free-form text for the employee to fill out however they pleased. They never had to do any kind of bs bookkeeping like updating the percentage complete a project was.

# I'm blocked because I don't have a textbox?

After months of hoping to find a replacement for Snippets, I realized something. Snippets is just a textbox. That Friday, I opened up Google Docs and wrote my update for the week:

{% include image.html file="docs-snippets.jpg" alt="Screenshot of my first Snippet in Google Docs" max_width="500px" img_link="true" class="img-border" fig_caption="Recording weekly status updates in Google Docs" %}

I did this every week for a year. Nobody read them, but that was fine. The act of writing them was useful in itself.

# Making my own tool

After a year of using Google Docs to record my status updates, I noticed some annoyances. Docs is heavyweight, so loading the page to enter my snippets took four or five seconds. Plus, it wasn't friendly to sharing single posts. I also kept thinking about features I wanted to add, like a tool that notices that you use the same headings each week, so it auto-populates them for you when you start writing.

I declared a goal at the start of the year to gain comfort with a frontend framework. I hadn't made any progress on that and I was between projects since my last business failed.

So I decided that making my own status update tool would be a great way to recover with a fun, straightforward project and to learn a new skill.

In May, I debuted What Got Done, a status update tool:

You can read all my weekly status updates and start entering your own every week. If you're interested in using this tool at work, send me an email.
