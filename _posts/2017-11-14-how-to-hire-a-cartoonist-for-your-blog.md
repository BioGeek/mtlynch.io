I had just completed a passionate blog post. Too passionate, maybe, as I had written over 8,000 words of text. That's about 1,000 times longer than they average *Buzzfeed* article. Worse, it was a giant wall of text with nary a visual element to break it up aside from some screenshots and tables (ooh, exciting tables!).

Then [*An Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments*](http://amzn.to/2jy2vND) popped into my mind. It's a beautifully illustrated book that explains logical fallacies. It uses cartoons to present dry, academic ideas in a fun, engaging way. 

Maybe if my massive tome of a blog article had some cartoons, one or two readers would get through the entire thing. I set about to hire a cartoonist, having no idea how to hire or work with one.

# How I hired a cartoonist

## Writing the job posting

I didn't really know what I these cartoons would look like. It seemed like the best way to figure it out was to hire a few different cartoonists so that I could see options. I didn't necessarily want the best person, but rather the best *idea* for the right style.

{% include image.html file="upwork-posting.png" max_width="400px" alt="Screenshot of job posting on Upwork" fig_caption="Job posting on Upwork" img_link=true %}

I posted a [job listing](https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01069b65ac37524889) on Upwork, a site I use frequently for hiring freelancers. It was effectively a paid design contest -- the freelancers were applying to be included in a shortlist, where they would each receive compensation for submitting a single cartoon. From the shortlist, one cartoonist would continue on to work with me on 8-10 more cartoons for the full blog post.

## Hiring Round 1: Choosing cartoonists to shortlist

Within XX hours, I received 13 submissions. I hired four for the shortlist:

* [Christine Elefsiniotis](https://www.facebook.com/christinaillustration/)
* [Loraine Yow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lolo-ology/)
* [Manel Sto Nino](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0146ddb5612a5aaaca)
* Sofia (she preferred I not link to her profile for this article)

Given that I only had five female applicants, I was surprised that all four who made it to the shortlist were women. Within the applicant pool, the men's portfolios were generally filled with illustrations in the style of political cartoons or graphic novels, which wasn't what I was looking for. The women's portfolio's contained more cartoons for advertisements or children's books. The latter was most similar to the style I had in mind.

TODO: Check

## Hiring Round 2: Choosing the final cartoonist

Once I had a shortlist, I commissioned each cartoonist to draw a cartoon based on the same description:

>I would like an illustration of two animals. One of the characters is straining to move a couch, carrying it on their back. The other is watching the first character and not helping, but the character says, "We should really move this couch."

For additional context, I linked to the [section](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/#never-say-you) of my blog post where the cartoon would appear.

### Sofia's submission

{% assign fig_caption = "Cartoon submission from Sofia" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="sample-sofia.jpg" max_width="500px" alt="Sample submission from Sofia" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

Sofia was the first artist to submit her sample. I didn't fall in love with it, but I felt like if it was the best I got, I'd be okay working with her for the full article.

The animals were anthropomorphized *just* enough to be funny, while still being fun and playful. I think she nailed the expressions. The cat looks kind of snobby, which is fitting for the article because it represents me. The dog is clearly struggling, but not so much that the reader feels bad for him.

### Manel's submission

{% assign fig_caption = "Cartoon submission from [Manel Sto Nino](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0146ddb5612a5aaaca)" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="sample-manel.jpg" max_width="500px" alt="Sample submission from Manel" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

Manel's submission was impressive in how *closely* it matched the style of *The Book of Bad Arguments*. Her first sketch was actually even more on the nose, but I asked her to tone it down a bit so that it didn't look like we were egregiously copying that artist.

{% assign fig_caption = '"Appeal to Ignorance," from [*An Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments*](http://amzn.to/2jy2vND)' | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="boba-appeal-to-ignorance.png" alt="Appeal to Ignorance image" max_width="400px" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

### Christine's submission

{% assign fig_caption = "Cartoon submission from [Christine Elefsiniotis](https://www.facebook.com/christinaillustration/)" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="sample-christine.jpg" max_width="500px" alt="Sample submission from Chrstine" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

Christine's was the most elaborate. We learn so much about the two characters and their relationship just from the little details about how they're dressed, their expressions, and what items appear in the background. It felt a bit like a *New Yorker* cartoon, which was maybe a bit more mature in style than what I had in mind.

### Winner: Loraine's submission

{% assign fig_caption = "Cartoon submission from [Loraine Yow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lolo-ology/)" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="sample-loraine.png" max_width="500px" alt="Sample submission from Loraine" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

Loraine's submission was the clear winner as soon as I saw it. It was everything I didn't realize I had been looking for the whole time.

I had led the artists astray by referencing *An Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments* . In that book, the cartoons are the star of the show. In my blog post, I wanted the cartoons to support the text, not the other way around.

Loraine's cartoon was by far the simplest, but it was also the most efficient. Like elegant code, it communicated the essential idea and eliminated everything else.

I offered Loraine the job, and she quickly agreed.

# How I worked with my cartoonist

## Thinking up concepts

When I got the idea to hire a cartoonist, I thought maybe they would just read my article and make up their own cartoons. That seemed like a win-win because they get creative freedom, I don't have to think up cartoons, and both of us save on communication time.

I asked Loraine if she'd be open to coming up with the concepts herself. said that that would be XX% more per cartoon. I was on track to spend ~$400 for illustrations. I was already questioning whether that was a ridiculous amount to spend on a blog post that nobody might read. $XX would cause me to raise a lot more questions with myself, so I resolved to just come up with my own cartoon ideas.

Thinking up cartoons turned out to be really fun! It got to pretend to be a cartoonist.

When I [outsourced my cooking](/taskrabbit-cooking/) to a task service, I realized that I enjoy cooking when I don't have to cook. With this project, I discovered that I enjoy making cartoons when I don't have to draw.

## Describing cartoons is hard

Everyone's heard the expression, "The value of a picture, when converted to units of words, is equal to one thousand of them." It turns out that's true. Especially when those words are trying to describe a picture.

After I hired Loraine to do the full set of cartoons, I tried to explain the next cartoon to her in prose. It immediately felt awkward and inefficient.

I felt like drawing was Loraine's job, words were my job, so I had to stay in my lane and not do any drawing. Then I realized that made no sense and it would be way easier if I sent her a basic sketch to convey my idea.

## But drawing stick figures is easy

It's easier if you can just see what this process looked like, so I'll demonstrate with my favorite cartoon from the blog post. It accompanied a [section about giving compliments](/human-code-reviews-2/#offer-sincere-praise):

{% include image.html file="mma-v3.png" max_width="500px" alt="Final version of MMA cartoon" img_link=true %}

That excellent cartoon began with this horrendous stick figure sketch I drew and gave to Loraine:

{% include image.html file="mma-stick-figures.jpg" max_width="600px" alt="My initial stick figure cartoon" img_link=true %}

I accompanied the drawing with this text description to Loraine:

>The dog has just finished fighting a shoe in an UFC match. I'm not sure how familiar you are with UFC, but the fights happen in an octagonal ring ([example](http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/0e446803915f4de18486c3f16e1f3b93/3d-rendered-illustration-of-an-mma-mixed-martial-arts-fighting-cage-hmfggb.jpg), [example](https://smhttp-ssl-55701.nexcesscdn.net/media/catalog/category/MMAMatCover.jpg)).

>A human referee is holding the dog's paw up in victory. UFC referees wear black pants, black polo shits, and gloves ([example](http://media.ufc.tv/200/UFC200feature_johnmccarthy/GettyImages-115727257.jpg), [example](http://mmatitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/32214_the_usa_today_8412900.0.jpg)).

>So the dog has won, but he has a black eye and some welts as if the shoe hit him back. The shoe is lying on its side on the ground, torn up.

>The cat is in the audience, cheering, "Beautiful grappling! You soundly defeated that shoe." The audience is full but it's just a faceless crowd aside from the cat

And Loraine sent me this initial sketch:

{% include image.html file="mma-sketch.png" max_width="600px" alt="Sketch of MMA cartoon" img_link=true %}

Right off the bat, the sketch was pretty close to what I wanted. I asked her to proceed with that sketch, and she sent me a more detailed version. We went a few rounds on minor fixes, but you can see the changes get smaller and smaller as we converge on the final design.

# Results

The article ended up getting a very positive response. It was the most widely reshared article I've ever written.

TODO: Add visitor numbers, retweet numbers.

Many commenters specifically cited the cartoons.

TODO: Show reddit comment

The biggest exposure of the article was getting tweeted by the twitter account for the Java programming language. They used one of Loraine's cartoons to liven up the tweet.

# Cost

| Expense | Cost |
|------------|-------|
| Four samples @ $30 | $120 |
| Block of 10 cartoons from Loraine | $280 |
| Additional cartoons from Loraine | $XX |
| **Total** | **$XX** |
| ***Average*** | ***$XX per cartoon*** |

It's more than I expected to spend at the outset, but here's how I rationalized the cost to myself: I had to break up the text somehow. It was either going to cost me money to hire someone or it would cost me hours and hours of my own time scouring the Internet for good stock photos.

Before I hired Loraine, I did try stock photos. The problem was I could only find images that *kind of* matched the sentiment I was trying to convey.

Let me give you an example. Searching through all the stock photos felt a bit like this:

{% include image.html file="pawel-janiak-114499.jpg" max_width="750px" alt="Person searching" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

See? It's something to look at, but it's not quite right.

# Tips for hiring cartoonists

I couldn't find any guides for hiring a cartoonist, so I was just making it up as I went along. I ran into a lot of decisions where I just didn't know what the standard procedure was. How many revisions could I ask for? Do I need to give attribution? Do we renegotiate rates if I asked for 10 cartoons but later wanted some of them to have multiple panels?

After I published the article with all of Loraine's cartoons, I asked the four cartoonists who I hired for samples if they'd let me interview them for this article. They all agreed.

Below, I've compiled tips for hiring and working with cartoonists based on those interviews and my experience working with them.

## Background: Nobody wants to work for a bad client

Every cartoonist I interviewed emphasized how unpleasant it is to work with a bad client.

On a site like Upwork, as soon as the job begins, the client holds tremendous power over the freelancer. The client gets to rate the freelancer when the work is complete, and negative ratings can be hugely damaging to a freelancer's future job prospects.

Illustrators want to avoid clients who fill force them to jump through ridiculous hoops under threat of a bad rating, so quality artists will simply decline jobs when the clients give off red flags. I didn't realize when I was hiring that the freelancers were probably screening me even more carefully than I was screening them.

A good client:

* Treats freelancers with professionalism
* Respects the freelancer's craft
  * The client should understand that what they're doing is art, and therefore takes time and skill

## 1. Start with a small job

It's difficult to choose a cartoonist based solely on their portfolios and a brief interview. Instead of investing a lot of time into careful screening, hire for a small job.

A small job also makes it economical to work with several cartoonists in parallel, as I did. I wasn't sure exactly what style I wanted, so this allowed me to see several different options realized fully.

## 2. Don't ask for free work

Resist the temptation to ask freelancers to draw you a free, custom sample cartoon as part of the interview process. Like any profession, the people who are good don't simply give away their work. Clients who insist on free samples are effectively filtering out the artists who are talented enough to be choosy about the jobs they take on.

## 3. Choose the right contract type for the job

You can either pay freelancers by the hour or hire them on a fixed-cost basis. A freelancer doesn't want to sign on for a $30 fixed-cost job only to be forced to re-do the work in 20 different ways until you decide what you want the cartoon to look like.

* Hire on a **fixed-cost basis** if you have a clear vision of what you want.  Define vision in the job description so that the freelancer knows that you know what you want.
* Hire on an **hourly basis** if you don't quite know what you want and you'd like the artist to help you explore different ideas.

## 4. Write a clear, thorough job description

Recall earlier when I said freelance cartoonists want to be treated with professionalism? A well-written and comprehensive job posting shows that you're a professional and you've done your due diligence. It gives them confidence that you're not going to waste their time by dribbling out little bits of information only after they produce work for you.

Even if you don't know the style that you want, you probably can decide on the technical details, such as:

* Image dimensions (in pixels)
* Color or black and white
* Usage rights
  * Do you need the full copyright or just the right to use it once?
  * If you're using a freelancer site like check the standard contract terms, as they may automatically give the client full rights to intellectual property (Upwork does).
* Image format
  * Do you just want rendered images (JPEG/PNG)? If you might have to edit the files later, you'll want the raw files as well?

## 5. Write personalized interview invitations

You'll likely find good candidates if you simply post the job and wait for candidates to contact you. But you can increase your chances of finding a good match by proactively checking out portfolios of available freelancers on the platform and personally inviting the ones you like.

Once you take the time to seek out this freelancer and look at their portfolio; take an extra minute or two to personalize the message and explain what you like about their work and why you think they might be a good match for your job.

This shows the freelancer that you have respect for their work. It reduces the risk that you're going to turn out to be a jerk who expects them to churn out artwork as if they're working on a factory line.

## 6. Consider total cost

As with any hourly job, look beyond the hourly rate and consider the total cost. You'll likely receive bids from low-cost contractors that have low hourly rates, but will actually cost you more. I also assume that your time is expensive, so things that save you a small amount of money at the expense of large amounts of your time should be bad.

1. **Weak communication skills**: Communication is *very* important on these jobs. Even with someone who speaks your language fluently, it's difficult to describe a picture you want someone to draw. A person who communicates poorly can burn a lot of your time. Look for red flags during the interview phase and on the first, short job you hire for.
1. **Shoddy work**:  If they're not giving attention to detail, you'll have to spend more time calling out issues.

## 7. Sketch your ideas first

The most efficient way I found to communicate my ideas was with a simple sketch. A simple stick figure drawing communicates a lot.

Start by sending your cartoonist a simple sketch of your own. Accompany it with a description of how you want them to develop it.

## 8. Include reference images

Imagine you want a cartoon that features a car. Well, there are lots of different types of cars. Is it a sports car or an SUV?

Think about the elements in your cartoon that could be drawn in a variety of ways, then use Google Image Search to find an image that matches what you have in mind.

## 9. Maintain reasonable expectations for revisions

The thing that gave me the most angst during this process was asking for revisions. I didn't know how many revisions was "normal." If I asked for five tweaks, was I a really demanding client exploiting my cartoonists time? Or do cartoonists expect lots of revisions just from the nature of the work?

I asked each of the cartoonists what they considered a normal range of revisions to ask for:

TODO: Cite each person's answers.

On an hourly contract, this matters less because you're compensating them for each revision.

If your idea changes, offer to compensate. If you started by saying you wanted a single image, but now you want an elaborate three-panel cartoon, that's more work for the cartoonist. This isn't a problem on an hourly contract, but on a fixed-price contract, you should adjust the contract price if you've had a change of heart that drastically changes the scope of work.

Once you accept the work, that's it. The job is over once you approve. If you later notice something wrong or you change your mind, don't expect to get those changes for free.

## 10. Give attribution

* Blog post: Expected, but not strictly required
* A published book: Required
* Logos / advertisements: Not expected

While none of the artists I spoke with said they strictly require it, they all agreed that it was standard to give attribution
