I had just completed a passionate blog post. Too passionate, maybe, as I had written over 8,000 words of text. That's about 1000x longer than they average *Buzzfeed* article. Worse, it was a giant wall of text with nary a visual element to break it up aside from some screenshots and a few tables. Ooh, exciting tables!

Then, [*An Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments*](http://amzn.to/2jy2vND) popped into my mind. It's a beautifully illustrated book that explains logical fallacies in a fun, engaging way.

TODO: Add book cover.

Maybe if my massive tome of a blog article had some cartoons, a handful of readers would get through the entire thing. I set about to hire a cartoonist, having no idea how to hire or work with one.

# How I hired a cartoonist

## Hiring Round 1: Choosing cartoonists to shortlist

I didn't really know what these cartoons would look like. It seemed like the best way to figure it out was to hire a few different cartoonists so that I could see options. I didn't necessarily want the best person, but rather the best *idea*.

It seemed gauche to ask for free samples, so I created a [job listing](https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01069b65ac37524889) where anyone I selected for a sample would be paid for their work

{% include image.html file="upwork-posting.png" max_width="400px" alt="Screenshot of job posting on Upwork" fig_caption="Job posting on Upwork" img_link=true %}

Within two days, I received 13 submissions. I hired four for the shortlist:

* [Christine Elefsiniotis](https://www.facebook.com/christinaillustration/)
* [Loraine Yow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lolo-ology/)
* [Manel Sto Nino](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0146ddb5612a5aaaca)
* Sofia (she preferred I not link to her profile for this article)

Given that I only had five female applicants, I was surprised that all four who made it to the shortlist were women.

Within the applicant pool, the men's portfolios were generally filled with illustrations in the style of political cartoons or graphic novels. The women's portfolio's contained more cartoons for advertisements or children's books. The latter was most similar to the style I had in mind.

## Hiring Round 2: Choosing the final cartoonist

Once I had a shortlist, I commissioned each cartoonist to draw a cartoon based on the same description:

>I would like an illustration of two animals. One of the characters is straining to move a couch, carrying it on their back. The other is watching the first character and not helping, but the character says, "We should really move this couch."

For additional context, I linked to the [section](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/#never-say-you) of my blog post where the cartoon would appear.

### Sofia's submission

{% assign fig_caption = "Cartoon submission from Sofia" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="sample-sofia.jpg" max_width="500px" alt="Sample submission from Sofia" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

Sofia was the first artist to submit her sample. I didn't fall in love with it, but I felt like if it was the best I got, I'd be okay working with her for the full article.

The animals were anthropomorphized *just* enough to be funny, while still being fun and playful. I think she nailed the expressions. The cat looks kind of snobby, which is fitting for the article because it represents me. The dog is clearly struggling, but not so much that the reader feels bad for him.

### Manel's submission

{% assign fig_caption = "Cartoon submission from [Manel Sto Nino](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0146ddb5612a5aaaca)" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="sample-manel.jpg" max_width="500px" alt="Sample submission from Manel" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

Manel's submission was impressive in how *closely* it matched the style of *The Book of Bad Arguments*. Her first sketch was actually even more on the nose, but I asked her to tone it down a bit so that it didn't look like we were egregiously copying that artist.

{% assign fig_caption = '"Appeal to Ignorance," from [*An Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments*](http://amzn.to/2jy2vND)' | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="boba-appeal-to-ignorance.png" alt="Appeal to Ignorance image" max_width="400px" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

### Christine's submission

{% assign fig_caption = "Cartoon submission from [Christine Elefsiniotis](https://www.facebook.com/christinaillustration/)" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="sample-christine.jpg" max_width="500px" alt="Sample submission from Chrstine" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

Christine's was the most elaborate. We learn so much about the two characters and their relationship just from the little details about how they're dressed, their expressions, and what items appear in the background. It felt a bit like a *New Yorker* cartoon, which was maybe a bit more mature in style than what I had in mind.

### Winner: Loraine's submission

{% assign fig_caption = "Cartoon submission from [Loraine Yow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lolo-ology/)" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="sample-loraine.png" max_width="500px" alt="Sample submission from Loraine" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

Loraine's submission was the clear winner as soon as I saw it. It was everything I didn't realize I had been looking for the whole time.

I had led the artists astray by referencing *An Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments* . In that book, the cartoons are the star of the show. In my blog post, I wanted the cartoons to support the text, not the other way around.

Loraine's cartoon was by far the simplest, but it was also the most efficient. Like elegant code, it communicated the essential idea and eliminated everything else.

I offered Loraine the job, and she promptly agreed.

# How I worked with my cartoonist

## Thinking up concepts

TODO: Transition

Thinking up cartoons turned out to be really fun! It got to pretend to be a cartoonist.

When I [outsourced my cooking](/taskrabbit-cooking/) to a task service, I realized that I enjoy cooking when I don't have to cook. With this project, I discovered that I enjoy making cartoons when I don't have to draw.

## Describing cartoons is hard

Everyone's heard the expression, "The value of a picture, when converted to units of words, is equal to one thousand of them." It turns out that's true. Especially when those words are trying to describe a picture.

After I hired Loraine to do the full set of cartoons, I tried to explain the next cartoon to her in prose. It immediately felt awkward and inefficient.

I felt like drawing was Loraine's job, words were my job, so I had to stay in my lane and not do any drawing. Then I realized that made no sense and it would be way easier if I sent her a basic sketch to convey my idea.

## But drawing stick figures is easy

It's easier if you can just see what this process looked like, so I'll demonstrate with my favorite cartoon from the blog post. It accompanied a [section about giving compliments](/human-code-reviews-2/#offer-sincere-praise):

{% include image.html file="mma-v3.png" max_width="500px" alt="Final version of MMA cartoon" img_link=true %}

That excellent cartoon began with this horrendous stick figure sketch I drew and gave to Loraine:

{% include image.html file="mma-stick-figures.jpg" max_width="600px" alt="My initial stick figure cartoon" img_link=true %}

I accompanied the drawing with this text description to Loraine:

>The dog has just finished fighting a shoe in an UFC match. I'm not sure how familiar you are with UFC, but the fights happen in an octagonal ring ([example](http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/0e446803915f4de18486c3f16e1f3b93/3d-rendered-illustration-of-an-mma-mixed-martial-arts-fighting-cage-hmfggb.jpg), [example](https://smhttp-ssl-55701.nexcesscdn.net/media/catalog/category/MMAMatCover.jpg)).

>A human referee is holding the dog's paw up in victory. UFC referees wear black pants, black polo shits, and gloves ([example](http://media.ufc.tv/200/UFC200feature_johnmccarthy/GettyImages-115727257.jpg), [example](http://mmatitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/32214_the_usa_today_8412900.0.jpg)).

>So the dog has won, but he has a black eye and some welts as if the shoe hit him back. The shoe is lying on its side on the ground, torn up.

>The cat is in the audience, cheering, "Beautiful grappling! You soundly defeated that shoe." The audience is full but it's just a faceless crowd aside from the cat

And Loraine sent me this initial sketch:

{% include image.html file="mma-sketch.png" max_width="600px" alt="Sketch of MMA cartoon" img_link=true %}

Right off the bat, the sketch was pretty close to what I wanted. I asked her to proceed with that sketch, and she sent me a more detailed version. We went a few rounds on minor fixes, but you can see the changes get smaller and smaller as we converge on the final design.

# Results

The article ended up getting a very positive response. It was the most widely reshared article I've ever written. My articles are generally not very popular on Twitter, but this one received hundreds of likes and retweets. The biggest exposure of the article was getting [tweeted by the Java programming language](https://twitter.com/java/status/918934115558313984). They used one of Loraine's cartoons to liven up the tweet.

On reddit, one of the [top comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/75wmuw/how_to_do_code_reviews_like_a_human/do9kdx9/) specifically cited the cartoons.

# Cost

| Expense | Cost |
|------------|-------|
| Four samples @ $30 | $120 |
| Block of 10 cartoons from Loraine | $280 |
| Additional cartoons from Loraine | $125 |
| **Total** | **$525** |
| ***Average*** | ***~$40 per cartoon*** |

It's more than I expected to spend at the outset, but here's how I rationalized the cost to myself: I had to break up the text somehow. It was either going to cost me money to hire someone or it would cost me hours and hours of my own time scouring the Internet for good stock photos.

Before I hired Loraine, I did try stock photos. The problem was I could only find images that *kind of* matched the sentiment I was trying to convey.

Let me give you an example. Searching through all the stock photos felt a bit like this:

{% assign fig_caption = "Photo by [Pawel Janiak](https://unsplash.com/photos/dxFi8Ea670E?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="pawel-janiak-114499.jpg" max_width="750px" alt="Person searching" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

See? It's something to look at, but it's not quite right.

# Tips for hiring cartoonists

Through the process of working with Loraine, there were many instances where I didn't know what the standard procedure was. How many revisions could I ask for? Do I need to give attribution? Do we renegotiate rates if I asked for 10 cartoons but later wanted some of them to have multiple panels?

After I published my article, I reached out to the four cartoonists I worked with to ask if they'd let me interview them for an article about the process of working with cartoonists. They all agreed.

Below, I've compiled tips for hiring and working with cartoonists based on those interviews and my experience as their client.

## Background: Nobody wants to work for a bad client

Every cartoonist I interviewed emphasized how unpleasant it is to work with a bad client. Bad clients make unreasonable demands and give bad ratings. Bad ratings make it hard for freelancers to win future jobs. Cartoonists screen their clients carefully during the interview process to avoid putting themselves at the mercy of a bad client.

You want to show potential applicants that you're a *good* client. A good client:

* Communicates with professionalism
* Respects the freelancer's craft
  * The client should understand that what they're doing is art, and therefore takes time and skill
  * Is respectful even when rejecting work. If the artist is to take pride in their work, it's insulting to hear, "No, this is bad," instead of a more respectful, "I'd like it to be more X."
* Either has a clear vision of what they want and can articulate it OR is willing to cede creative freedom to their cartoonist

## 1. Start with a small job

It's difficult to choose a cartoonist based solely on their portfolios and a brief interview. Instead of investing hours into lengthy interviews, hire for a small job.

Hiring this way also makes it economical to work with several cartoonists in parallel, as I did. I wasn't sure exactly what style I wanted, so this allowed me to see several different options realized fully.

## 2. Don't ask for free work

Resist the temptation to ask freelancers to draw you a free, custom sample cartoon as part of the interview process. Like any profession, the people who are good don't simply give away their work.

Good artists can be choosy about the opportunities they pursue. They'll simply decline jobs that require them to do free work up-front. Demands for free samples are a big red flag to applicants that you don't value their time.

## 3. Choose the right contract type for the job

You can either pay freelancers by the hour or agree to a fixed cost per cartoon.

* Hire on a **fixed-cost basis** if you have a clear vision of what you want.
* Hire on an **hourly basis** if you don't quite know what you want and you'd like the artist to help you explore different ideas.

## 4. Write a clear, thorough job description

Invest time into writing your job posting. Think carefully about your job to figure out what details are relevant to a potential cartoonist and anticipate what questions they might have.

A well-written and comprehensive job posting shows freelancers that you're a professional and will treat the people who work with you in a capable, respectful way.

If your listing is basically, "Looking for cartoonist who draws good," it sends the message that you view artists as interchangeable cogs that crank out work on demand. This will only attract low-quality cartoonists who are desperate for any work.

Even if you don't know the style that you want, you probably can decide on the technical details of the artwork, such as:

* Purpose
  * Will it be appear in a blog article? Is it your new website logo?
* Image dimensions (in pixels)
* Color or black and white
* Usage rights
  * Do you need the full copyright or just the right to use it once?
  * If you're using a freelancer site, check the standard contract terms, as they may automatically give the client full intellectual property rights (Upwork does).
* Image format
  * Do you just want the finished images (jpeg/png)?
  * If you might edit the files later, you'll want the raw files as well.

## 5. Write personalized interview invitations

Platforms like Upwork allow you to search for available freelancers and invite them to apply to your job. Take advantage of this to increase the quality of your applicant pool.

Browse the portfolios of available artists. If you like a particular freelancer, take a few minutes to write them a personalized note explaining what you like about their work and why you think they might be a good match for your job.

If you shotgun out a bunch of generic, spam invitations, expect to receive boring, low-effort applications in response. Personalized invitations incentivize the applicants to take the time to understand your project and articulate how they can help you.

## 6. Consider total cost

Artists will send bids for the rate they'll charge you if hired. Look beyond that number, and consider the total cost of the work, which is based on four variables:

1. Freelancer's bid rate
1. Number of hours freelancer will require to complete the work (if contract is hourly)
1. Number of hours you will spend managing the work
1. The rate at which you value your own time

(1) you know exactly.

(4) you know as well, but it's hard to come up with a precise number.

(2) and (3) you have to estimate based on the complexity of the work and the applicant's skill level. A low-skilled applicant may compensate with a cheap bid, but consider how many more hours it will take them to get the work right and how much more actively you'll need to manage them.

Avoid hiring a freelancer who doesn't speak your language fluently, as this will drive up (2) and (3). Even between two people who speak comfortably in the same language, it's surprisingly difficult to describe a cartoon. If you're working with someone whose language ability is weak, you're going to waste cycles to communication failures.

## 7. Sketch your ideas first

I found the quickest way to start describing a cartoon idea was with a simple sketch. You don't need a graphics tablet or Photoshop. Just draw on a piece of paper and take a picture of it. You're trying to capture the broad ideas, not the specifics.

You should still send your cartoonist a text description of the concept. But the sketch creates a shared foundation from which to build.

## 8. Provide reference images

Imagine you want a cartoon that features a car. Well, there are lots of different types of cars. Is it a sports car? An SUV? A sedan?

If there are elements in your cartoon that could be drawn in a variety of ways, use Google Image Search to find an image that matches what you have in mind. Send links to your cartoonist so they understand what you're thinking.

## 9. Maintain reasonable expectations for revisions

The thing that gave me the most angst during this process was asking for revisions. I didn't know how many revisions was "normal." If I asked for five tweaks, was I a really demanding client exploiting my cartoonist's time? Or are frequent revisions just an expected part of the job?

I asked a few of the cartoonists what they considered a normal range of revisions to ask for:

* Christine: Fewer than six or seven is reasonable
* Manel: Hard limit at three revisions
* Sofia: Around two or three, but she accepts unlimited revisions because she is still a beginner

On an hourly contract, revision limits matter less because you're paying for the time. For a fixed-cost contract, you should stay within a reasonable number of revisions.

## 10. Compensate when scope expands

If your idea changes, offer to compensate. If you started by saying you wanted a single image, but now you want an elaborate three-panel cartoon, that's more work for the cartoonist. This isn't a problem on an hourly contract, but on a fixed-price contract, you should adjust the contract price if you've had a change of heart that drastically changes the scope of work.

## 11. No backsies

Once you accept the work, that's it. The job is over once you approve.

If you later notice something wrong or you change your mind, that consitutes new work and merits a discussion between you and your freelancer about appropriate pay.

## 12. Give attribution

While none of the artists I spoke with said they strictly require it, they all agreed that it was standard practice to give attribution if their work is used in a blog post.
