I had just written a passionate blog post. Too passionate, maybe, as I had written over 8,000 words of text, which is about 1,000 times longer than they average *Buzzfeed* article. Worse, it was mostly a giant wall of text with nary a visual element to break it up aside from some screenshots and tables (ooh, exciting tables!).

Then [*An Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments*](http://amzn.to/2jy2vND) popped into my mind. It's a beautifully illustrated book that explained logical fallacies in simple terms. I loved it. It used cartoons to present dry, academic ideas in a fun, engaging way. 

It seemed clear that my behemoth tome of a blog article needed some cartoons to help the reader through it. I set about to hire a cartoonist, having no idea how to hire or work with one.

# How I hired a cartoonist

## Writing the job posting

I hire freelancers regularly, and I always start with a small job to see how we work together. With this project, I wanted to do it a little differently. I wanted to see several illustrators draw one cartoon each so that I'd have a variety of concepts to choose from. I didn't necessarily want the best person, but rather the best *idea* for the style of cartoon for this article.

{% include image.html file="upwork-posting.png" max_width="400px" alt="Screenshot of job posting on Upwork" fig_caption="Job posting on Upwork" img_link=true %}

I posted [a job](https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~01069b65ac37524889) on Upwork, a site I use frequently for hiring freelancers. The description explained that it was effectively a paid design contest, where I would compensate them for submitting a single cartoon, but I'd pick my favorite to do all of the illustrations in the article.

## Hiring Round 1: Choosing cartoonists to shortlist

I received 13 submissions and reduced it to a shortlist of four.

Interestingly, all four applicants in the shortlist were women, even though only 5/13 applicants were female. I'm not sure about cartoonists in general, but within my applicant pool, female cartoonists had a style more consistent with children's books. Male cartoonists had a style aimed at adults, such as graphic novels or webcomics.

The four

* [Christine Elefsiniotis](https://www.facebook.com/christinaillustration/)
* [Loraine Yow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lolo-ology/)
* [Manel Sto Nino](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0146ddb5612a5aaaca)
* Sofia (she preferred I not link to her profile for this article)

## Hiring Round 2: Choosing the final cartoonist

Once I had a shortlist, I commissioned each cartoonist to draw a cartoon based on the same description:

>I would like an illustration of two animals. One of the characters is straining to move a couch, carrying it on their back. The other is watching the first character and not helping, but the character says, "We should really move this couch."

I also linked to the [relevant section](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews/#never-use-the-word-you) of the blog post to give the cartoonists additional context into the idea.

### Sofia's submission

{% assign fig_caption = "Cartoon submission from Sofia" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="sample-sofia.jpg" max_width="500px" alt="Sample submission from Sofia" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

Sofia was the first artist to submit her sample. I didn't fall in love with it, but I felt like if it was the best I got, I'd be okay working with her for the full article.

The animals were anthropomorphized *just* enough to be funny, while still being fun and playful. I think she nailed the expressions. The cat looks kind of snobby, which is fitting for the article because it kind of represents me. The dog is clearly struggling, but not so much that the reader feels bad for him.

### Manel's submission

{% assign fig_caption = "Cartoon submission from [Manel Sto Nino](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0146ddb5612a5aaaca)" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="sample-manel.jpg" max_width="500px" alt="Sample submission from Manel" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

Manel's submission was impressive in how *closely* it matched the style of *The Book of Bad Arguments*. Her first sketch was actually even more on the nose, but I asked her to tone it down a bit so that it didn't look like we were egregiously copying that artist.

{% assign fig_caption = '"Appeal to Ignorance," from [*An Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments*](http://amzn.to/2jy2vND)' | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="boba-appeal-to-ignorance.png" alt="Appeal to Ignorance image" max_width="400px" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

### Christine's submission

{% assign fig_caption = "Cartoon submission from [Christine Elefsiniotis](https://www.facebook.com/christinaillustration/)" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="sample-christine.jpg" max_width="500px" alt="Sample submission from Chrstine" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

Christine's was the most elaborate. We learn so much about the two characters and their relationship just from the little details about how they're dressed, their expressions, and what items appear in the background. It felt a bit like a *New Yorker* cartoon, which was maybe a bit more mature in style than what I had in mind.

### Winner: Loraine's submission

{% assign fig_caption = "Cartoon submission from [Loraine Yow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lolo-ology/)" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="sample-loraine.png" max_width="500px" alt="Sample submission from Loraine" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

Loraine's submission was the clear winner as soon as I saw it. It was everything I didn't realize I had been looking for the whole time. I didn't want intricate; I wanted simple.

I had led the artists astray by referencing *The Book of Bad Arguments* because in that book, the cartoons are the star of the show. In my blog post, I wanted the cartoons to support the text, not the other way around.

It was by far the simplest of the lot, but it was also the most efficient. Like elegant code, it communicated the essential idea and eliminated everything else.

# How I worked with my cartoonist

## Thinking up concepts

When I got the idea to hire a cartoonist, I thought maybe they would just read my article and make up their own cartoons. That seemed like a win-win because they get creative freedom, I don't have to think up cartoons, and both of us save on communication time.

I asked Loraine if she'd be open to coming up with the concepts herself. said that that would be XX% more per cartoon. I was expecting to spend about $350 on illustrations for the post. That already felt high, so $XX was out of my budget. I'd just come up with my own ideas.

It turned out to be really fun! I got to pretend to be a cartoonist. When I outsourced my cooking to a chef, I realized that I enjoy cooking when I don't have to cook. With this job, I discovered that I enjoy making cartoons when I don't have to draw.

## Describing cartoons is hard

Everyone's heard the expression, "The value of a picture, when converted to units of words, is equal to one thousand of them." It turns out that's true. Especially when the thing you're describing is a picture.

After I hired Loraine to do the full set of cartoons, I tried to describe the next cartoon to her in an email. I had the image in my mind, but describing it in an email immediately felt awkward and inefficient. For some reason, I felt like drawing was Loraine's job, words were my job, so I had to stay in my lane and not do any drawing. Then I realized that made no sense and it would be way easier if I sent her a basic sketch to convey my idea.

## But drawing stick figures is easy

My favorite cartoon from the blog post was this one, which accompanied a section about giving compliments:

{% include image.html file="mma-v3.png" max_width="500px" alt="Final version of MMA cartoon" img_link=true %}

It's also a good demonstration of the process Loraine and I followed for creating all the cartoons. It began with this beautiful stick figure drawing:

{% include image.html file="mma-stick-figures.jpg" max_width="600px" alt="My initial stick figure cartoon" img_link=true %}

I accompanied the stick figure sketch with this text description:

>The dog has just finished fighting a shoe in an UFC match. I'm not sure how familiar you are with UFC, but the fights happen in an octagonal ring ([example](http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/0e446803915f4de18486c3f16e1f3b93/3d-rendered-illustration-of-an-mma-mixed-martial-arts-fighting-cage-hmfggb.jpg), [example](https://smhttp-ssl-55701.nexcesscdn.net/media/catalog/category/MMAMatCover.jpg)).

>A human referee is holding the dog's paw up in victory. UFC referees wear black pants, black polo shits, and gloves ([example](http://media.ufc.tv/200/UFC200feature_johnmccarthy/GettyImages-115727257.jpg), [example](http://mmatitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/32214_the_usa_today_8412900.0.jpg)).

>So the dog has won, but he has a black eye and some welts as if the shoe hit him back. The shoe is lying on its side on the ground, torn up.

>The cat is in the audience, cheering, "Beautiful grappling! You soundly defeated that shoe." The audience is full but it's just a faceless crowd aside from the cat

And Loraine sent me this initial sketch:

{% include image.html file="mma-sketch.png" max_width="600px" alt="Sketch of MMA cartoon" img_link=true %}

Right off the bat, the sketch was pretty close to what I wanted. She sent me a more detailed version and we went a few rounds on minor fixes, but you can see the changes get smaller and smaller as we converge on the final design.

# Cost

The bad news is that this was expensive:

| Expense | Cost |
|------------|-------|
| Four samples @ $30 | $120 |
| Block of 10 cartoons from Loraine | $280 |
| Additional cartoons from Loraine | $XX |
| **Total** | **$XX** |
| ***Average*** | ***$XX per cartoon*** |

The good news is that it was primarily expensive because I used a lot of cartoons in that blog article. Recall that it was 8,000 words, split into two posts, so there was a lot of text to break up. If I average it out to a per-cartoon basis, $XX is not that steep.

It's more than I expected to spend at the outset, but here's how I rationalized the cost to myself:

I had to break up the text somehow. If I didn't hire a cartoonists, I'd have used stock photos. I actually started out searching for stock photos, but I felt like I was wasting a lot of time searching through images. I'd find images that *kind of* matched the sentiment I was trying to convey, but not perfectly.

Searching through all the stock photos felt a bit like this:

{% include image.html file="pawel-janiak-114499.jpg" max_width="750px" alt="Person searching" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

See? It's something to look at, but it's not quite right.

# Tips for hiring cartoonists

I couldn't find any guides for hiring a cartoonist, so I was just making it up as I went along. I ran into a lot of decisions where I just didn't know what the standard procedure was. How many revisions could I ask for? Do I need to give attribution? Do we renegotiate rates if I asked for 10 cartoons, but later decide I want some of them to have multiple panels?

After I published the article with all of Loraine's cartoons, I reached out to the four cartoonists who I hired for samples, and they all agreed to let me interview them about their experiences working as freelance cartoonists.

Below, I've compiled tips for hiring and working with cartoonists based on those interviews and my experience working with them.

## Background: Nobody wants to work for a bad client

Every cartoonist I interviewed emphasized how unpleasant it is to work with a bad client.

On a site like Upwork, as soon as the job begins, the client holds tremendous power over the freelancer. The client gets to rate the freelancer when the work is complete, and negative ratings can be hugely damaging to a freelancer's future job prospects.

Illustrators want to avoid clients who fill force them to jump through ridiculous hoops under threat of a bad rating, so quality artists will simply decline jobs when the clients give off red flags. I didn't realize when I was hiring that the freelancers were probably screening me even more carefully than I was screening them.

A good client:

* Treats freelancers with professionalism
* Respects the freelancer's craft
  * The client should understand that what they're doing is art, and therefore takes time and skill

## 1. Start with a small job

It's difficult to choose a cartoonist based on only on their portfolios and a brief interview. Instead of investing a lot of time into careful screening, hire for a small job.

A small job also makes it economical to work with several cartoonists redundantly, as I did. I wasn't sure exactly what style I wanted, so this allowed me to see several different options realized fully.

## 2. Don't ask for free work

Resist the temptation to ask freelancers to draw you a custom sample cartoon for free as part of the interview process. Like any profession, the people who are good don't just give away their work.

By insisting on free samples, all you're really doing is filtering out the artists who are talented enough to be choosy about the jobs they take on.

## 3. Write a clear, thorough job description

What size do you need? Do you want just the final images or do you want the raw files as well in case you need to make edits later?

TODO: Cut?

## 4. Choose the right contract type for the job

You can either pay freelancers by the hour or hire them on a fixed-cost basis. A freelancer doesn't want to sign on for a $30 fixed-cost job only to be forced to re-do the work in 20 different ways until you decide what you want the cartoon to look like.

Hire on a fixed-cost basis if you have a clear vision of what you want.  Put this vision in the job description so that the freelancer knows that you know what you want.

It's fine to hire an artist if you don't quite know what you want and you'd like them to help you explore different ideas. In this case, you should pay by the hour.

## 5. Specify usage rights

TODO: Talk about copyright.

## 5. Write personalized interview invitations

You'll likely find good candidates if you simply post the job and wait for candidates to contact you. But you can increase your chances of finding a good match by proactively checking out portfolios of available freelancers on the platform and personally inviting the ones you like.

Christine mentioned that a client once began an invitation to apply to a job with, "HEY, YOU. YES, YOU!" If a software recruiter contacted me with a message that began that way, I'd delete their email immediately.

On most freelancer platforms, it will populate the invitation with something generic, like, "I'd like to invite you to apply for my job." If you took the time to seek out this freelancer and look at their portfolio, take an extra minute or two to personalize the message and explain what you like about their work and why you think they might be a good match for your job.

This shows the freelancer that you have respect for their work and reduces the risk that you're going to turn out to be a jerk who expects them to churn out artwork as if they're working on a factory line.

## 6. Consider total cost

As with any hourly job, look beyond the hourly rate and consider the total cost. You'll likely receive bids from low-cost contractors that have low hourly rates, but will actually cost you more. I also assume that your time is expensive, so things that save you a small amount of money at the expense of large amounts of your time should be bad.

1. **Weak communication skills**: Communication is *very* important on these jobs. Even with someone who speaks your language fluently, it's difficult to describe a picture you want someone to draw. A person who communicates poorly can burn a lot of your time. Look for red flags during the interview phase and on the first, short job you hire for.
1. **Shoddy work**:  If they're not giving attention to detail, you'll have to spend more time calling out issues.

## 7. Sketch your ideas first

Context didn't matter.

## 8. Maintain reasonable expectations for revisions

If your idea changes, offer to compensate.

Answers varied.

Once you accept the work, that's it. The job is over once you approve. If you later notice something wrong or you change your mind, don't expect to get those changes for free.

## 9. Give attribution

* A published book: Always
* Blog post: It's expected, but not strictly required
* Logos / advertisements: Attribution is not expected

While none of the artists I spoke with said they strictly require it, they all agreed that it was standard to give attribution
