Today marks a full year of working for myself after quitting my job as a software engineer at Google.

# I bought a house

I'll go into more details later in the post, but I bought a house this year. It's has a big impact on how I spent time and money, so getting that out of the way.

# How I made and spent money

Money is one of the biggest motivators and obstacles to starting a business. It's the thing most people are interested in, so I'll start there.

Table of what I spent money on and what I earned money from.

In one sense, I lost $20k over a year. But also, I grew profits by almost $1k each month! Just kidding. I basically just

I turned a profit in November, but for silly reasons. Freelancers are my biggest expense, and in November, I didn't work with any of them, so I made $XX from my blog and spent $XX on hosting for a cool profit of $XX.

# Project by project

mtlynch.io (this blog)

My biggest source of revenue in 2018 was this blog. I deliberately avoid monetizing this blog. I'd rather this blog be a place where I can talk credibly about things I'm interested in and get people interested in my projects. But, despite my best efforts, this blog earned the most money of my projects.

In 2018, this blog receied 568k unique visitors and earned $1.2k in affiliate revenue, which I think is on the low side.

Affiliate revenue: $1243.74
Editing: $XX
Illustrations: $XX
Development: $XX
Hosting: $XX
Net profit: $XX

Is It Keto

Is It Keto is my current focus. For followers of the keto diet, this website gives clear, simple answers about whether particular foods are compatible with the diet.

Space Duck

Space Duck was a project for me to build something on top of Sia. After running some experiments, I decided that Sia was not yet ready to support anything I had in mind, so I moved on.

KetoHub

KetoHub is a project I started last year. It's an aggregator / search engine for keto recipes. I couldn't find any ways to monetize or grow it without investing a large amount of time, so it's in maintenance mode and I occasionally add features for fun.

# Buying my first house

At the end of the summer, I moved. I was 

A few months after I started at Google, I moved into an apartment that was a few blocks from my office. I grew to love the apartment, but rent was at a premium to be so close to Google. After I quit, I was paying that premium for no reason.

One day, I joked to my sister that I should buy a cheap house near her in Western Massachussetts. She called me and said, "Were you joking? Because you really should do that." The more I thought about it, the more sense it made. It was close to my family.

One of the biggest reasons was that while I lived in New York, my time felt so metered. Between rent, health insurance, food, and other regular living expenses, my living expenses were $6-7k per month. That meant that if I worked on a business idea for three months, it was the equivalent of investing $20,000 in it.

The metering led to me focusing heavily on outsourcing my work, which [had its own problems](/outsourcing-mvp/). And that pushed me toward

So I bought a house. It was $200k, which was roughly the cost of a down payment on an apartment like the one I lived in in New York. I paid cash, so my only housing expenses are utilities and property taxes.

# Not having money is stressful

I believe I'm the first person to ever make this observation, but it's hard to not have much money. Another big secret: tech companies pay really well. So for a long time, I was earning enough money that I never had to think about money. I could spend a few thousand dollars on a big screen TV or a top-end computer and it wouldn't have a noticeable effect on my finances. I generally don't throw around money, but even when I had big expenses, I still had enough money left at the end of the month to put into savings.

That mentality lasted for about nine months after I quit my job. It didn't change until I ran out of money in my checking account. I was keeping my spending low but for most of 2018, I had a large sum of money in my checking account in anticipation of buying a house. After I purchased the house and moved my money back into investments and my checking account held only a couple thousand dollars, that's when the money stress hit again.

Because that forced money decisions to feel more real. When I had a bunch of money in checking, it just felt like I was drawing from this endless supply of money. Once the money was in investments, it forced me to make more explicit choices: I'm taking a thousand dollars out of my savings to pay myself. And the other thing I never considered was that earnings from my invesmtents are my primary income now. So every time I withdraw from savings, I reduce my income.

# Why I'm not consulting

When I talk to other developers about what I'm doing, they often assume that I'm taking on consulting work to make money. But I'm not. And that surprises and confuses them. Do I want consulting work? Why not do consulting work? It's a guaranteed cash inflow as I build my business.

I think what's unique about my position is that I have more in savings than the typical entrepreneur. Based on my current spending, my cost of living roughly matches my returns from savings, so I could do this forever and not run out of money.

So if I don't need the money from consulting, should I still do it? A common theme in stories of successful startups is that they were consulting to pay the bills, but then they recognized some unmet need in their consulting that they could make into a business. And that part of it seems appealing, but my thinking is that even though my businesses are not earning money, I'm hopefully gaining skills at running a business. I don't think anyone is guaranteed to be successful at starting a business. But I hope that by focusing only on my businesses, I'm increasing my chances of being successful.

The wrinkle is that I would take consulting work if the money was absurdly good. But the problem is that from what I understand about consulting, you only talk money after demonstrating to the client how well you can solve the problem. The things I'm known for are code reviews and quitting jobs, neither of which are very easy to translate into ROI for clients. "If your employees stop being obnoxious to each other on code reviews, it will increase your revenues by 30%!" I'm sure in some cases, that statement is true, but it's very hard to prove, and thus very difficult to put my value in dollar terms.

It seems like a nice benefit is that it keeps you connected to real clients and helps you think about what kind of services to offer.

# Having doubts about my skills

I worry about whether I chose a path that makes the worst of my skills. I think my best qualities as a developer was how I think about teams and process. I'm a very thorough code reviewer. I like making sure processes are documented and repeatable. I like writing and reviewing design plans. None of those things are useful as a one-man development team.

I also have doubts about what I'm working on. My current projects is Is It Keto. It's a website that tells you whether certain foods are compatible with the keto diet. It's one of the least technically complex things I've ever worked on. I have fun working on it, and it's exactly the kind of project I envisioned working on. Each month, I'm attracting more active users and growing revenue. I'm learning new skills in web development and search engine optimization. But I admit that it's embarrassing when people ask me what kind of business I run, and I say it's a directory where people look up whether foods are keto or not.

# Having doubts about my work

I also worry about whether I'm taking enough risk. One of my realizations about Zestful was that I was spinning my wheels on busywork to avoid the scary part where I cold pitch to businesses. Is It Keto notably is a business-to-consumer website, which means I don't have to pitch to anyone. I don't have to convince anyone that using it will make the money.

I made my first dollar of revenue within a week of picking the project up again, so I think there's potential in it, but it's also . It does tick all my boxes of a project. I am growing its traffic measurably month over month, I'm growing its revenue month over month,

I am going to stick with Is It Keto for the time being because it does match a lot of what I find fun about starting a small business:

* I'm making changes that have measurable effect on growth

# What I miss about employment

People ask me if I miss Google. Looking back, I definitely miss the perks, but on a day to day basis, I don't feel like I'm missing anything except for one thing: smart people.

I mean that both in the sense that it's good to have smart teammates. One thing I never realized that I took for granted was that when you're surrounded by smart people, most of the information available to you is good information. While I was at Google, I learned a lot about the language Python. Before that, I had only taught myself Python and didn't know industry-standard practices. I learned that a lot of what I had been doing was wrong (TODO: link good devs, bad tests) and institutional knowledge at Google taught me ways of doing things better.

Now that I'm on my own, I'm trying to learn about web development on my own. I want to learn what the industry standard practices are, but I can't because . For a while, I was hiring tutors to teach me web technologies, but that was hard too. If I don't know a subject, how do I know that they know what they're talking about? I know Python so I can identify people who are good at Python. I don't know Angular, so it's hard for me to figure out who's good at Angular.

For example, I've spent the last

# Staying motivated

Hasn't been a problem. Biggest problem is knowing when to quit or pivot.

A lot of people have said to me, "Oh, I couldn't work for myself. I'd just watch TV all day." I didn't think that was going to happen, and it hasn't. I do love programming, so that's the thing I do when I'm bored.

A few months in, I did feel not so much unmotivated, but unproductive. And that's when I started writing Snippets. Snippets are a Google thing where, at the end of each week, you write down what you accomplished. It's very free-form. Some people wrote a sentence or two. I wrote bulleted lists. At first I did it to keep my manager informed. Then, I switched managers and my new manager didn't read my snippets, but I realized that they were valuable to me. They were a good way to close out the week.

It's very easy to go a week and feel like nothing got done. That was discouraging. But when I write my snippets, it forces me to look back on my week and recognize how I spent my time. It often turns out that I don't give myself enough credit for what I did. On weeks I feel unproductive, it's often because my memory is lying to me and telling me that interesting accomplishments happened in other weeks.

Writing snippets.

Other habits have gotten better. I'm much better about not checking my phone, email, and social media constantly.

The habit that I was surprised died was exercise. I thought that once I quit, I'd exercise every day and be in peak physical condition. Instead, it turns out that having to go to my office was the thing that broke the surface tension of staying in my house. Now I exercise *way* less. But I have to do a lot more yardwork than I did in Manhattan, so I tell myself it evens out (it doesn't).

# I still love it

I dread going back

People ask me if I regret quitting and I definitely do not. Even when I do stress about money, I'd gladly take that over the stress of having to spend my day according to other people's schedules, carrying out tasks that other people choose for me. I really want this to be how I spend the rest of my life.

I love waking up whenever I want. I love that some days I can spontaneously decide it's a vacation day. It's how I want to spend the rest of my life.

# Goals for year two

I've been following another solo developer named Cory Zue. He's fun to watch because he's doing something very similar to what I want. His business is also. But something he did which I'll steal is setting yearly goals.

My goals for 2019:

* Earn $500/month in revenue from my businesses.
* Attract XXk readers to my blog (or just number of articles?)
