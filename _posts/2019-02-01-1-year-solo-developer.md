Today marks a full year of working for myself after quitting my job as a software engineer at Google.

# How I made and spent money

Money is one of the biggest motivators and obstacles to starting your own business. It's the thing most people are interested in, so I'll start there.

Table of what I spent money on and what I earned money from.

# Not having money is stressful

I believe I'm the first person to ever make this observation, but it's hard to not have much money.

Weird not to have money coming in. Didn't really feel weird until I got rid of cash. Had lots of cash from selling investments Google bonus payout. Got weird when I have to sell investments to cover my costs because the more investments I sell, the less money I earn from investments.

# Why I'm not consulting

People keep offering me consulting jobs. The only way I'd do it is if it were $10k per week. Even though I'm not making money from my businesses, I'm hopefully gaining skills to make me better at launching businesses.

# Buying my first house

At the end of the summer, I moved. I was 

A few months after I started at Google, I moved into an apartment that was a few blocks from my office. I grew to love the apartment, but rent was at a premium to be so close to Google. After I quit, I was paying that premium for no reason.

One day, I joked to my sister that I should buy a cheap house near her in Western Massachussetts. She called me and said, "Were you joking? Because you really should do that." The more I thought about it, the more sense it made. It was close to my family.

One of the biggest reasons was that while I lived in New York, my time felt so metered. Between rent, health insurance, food, and other regular living expenses, my living expenses were $6-7k per month. That meant that if I worked on a business idea for three months, it was the equivalent of investing $20,000 in it.

The metering led to me focusing heavily on outsourcing my work, which [had its own problems](/outsourcing-mvp/). And that pushed me toward

So I bought a house. It was $200k, which was roughly the cost of a down payment on an apartment like the one I lived in in New York. I paid cash, so my only housing expenses are utilities and property taxes.

# Doubts

Best at working in teams

Is this ambitious enough?

Shame about working on something that sounds so basic.

I also have doubts about what I'm working on. My current projects is Is It Keto. It's a website that just tells you whether certain foods are keto or not. It's one of the least technically complex things I've ever worked on. I do miss the days of Google where anything I was doing sounded impressive. While I was a developer at Google, I didn't even have to say what I did exactly and it sounded impressive. "What do you do at Google?" "I work on Google Maps." "No way! I *use* Google Maps!" It didn't matter that everything I worked on was thrown away due to reorgs.

I made my first dollar of revenue within a week of picking the project up again, so I think there's potential in it, but it's also . It does tick all my boxes of a project. I am growing its traffic measurably month over month, I'm growing its revenue month over month,

>Exactly! See you get it!

# What I miss about employment

People ask me if I miss Google. Looking back, I definitely miss the perks, but on a day to day basis, I don't feel like I'm missing anything except for one thing: smart people.

I mean that both in the sense that it's good to have smart teammates. One thing I never realized that I took for granted was that when you're surrounded by smart people, most of the information available to you is good information. While I was at Google, I learned a lot about the language Python. Before that, I had only taught myself Python and didn't know industry-standard practices. I learned that a lot of what I had been doing was wrong (TODO: link good devs, bad tests) and institutional knowledge at Google taught me ways of doing things better.

Now that I'm on my own, I'm trying to learn about web development on my own. I want to learn what the industry standard practices are, but I can't because . For a while, I was hiring tutors to teach me web technologies, but that was hard too. If I don't know a subject, how do I know that they know what they're talking about? I know Python so I can identify people who are good at Python. I don't know Angular, so it's hard for me to figure out who's good at Angular.

For example, I've spent the last

Well

# Staying motivated

Hasn't been a problem. Biggest problem is knowing when to quit or pivot.

A lot of people have said to me, "Oh, I couldn't work for myself. I'd just watch TV all day." I didn't think that was going to happen, and it hasn't. I do love programming, so that's the thing I do when I'm bored.

Writing snippets.

Other habits have gotten better. I'm much better about not checking my phone, email, and social media constantly.

The habit that I was surprised died was exercise. While I had a job, I kept thinking, "Oh boy, once I quit my job, I'm going to be in peak physical form!" While I had a job, I lifted weights and went running 2-5 times per week. Since quitting, I'm lucky if I do that in a month. I underestimated how much going to the office broke the surface tension of being at home. Because before, I had to leave the house anyway, so I might as well get some exercise. Now, with my schedule so unstructured and with so much comfort at home, it's so easy to put it off.

10am: I'm really focused in the morning. I'll go in the afternoon.
1pm: I feel full from lunch. I'll go in an hour.
2pm: Now I'm back in the zone! I'll work for an hour.
3:30pm: Okay, I'm going now. Let me just finish a few things first.
4:15pm: Oh no! Now my workout will extend past 5pm and that's when the gym is super crowded. I'll just go tomorrow.

# I still love it

I dread going back
