Today marks a full year of working for myself after quitting my job as a software engineer at Google.

# How I made and spent money

I'll start with the thing most people are interest in: money. It is both the biggest motivator and obstacle to starting a business.

Table of what I spent money on and what I earned money from.

Screenshot via Bench (TODO: link).

In one sense, I lost $20k over a year. But also, I grew profits by almost $1k each month! Just kidding. I basically just

I turned a profit in November, but for silly reasons. Freelancers are my biggest expense, and in November, I didn't work with any of them, so I made $XX from my blog and spent $XX on hosting for a cool profit of $XX.

This of course only reflects my business income and expenses. I'll get to my personal expenses a bit later.

# Project by project

mtlynch.io (this blog)

My biggest source of revenue in 2018 was this blog. I deliberately avoid monetizing this blog. I'd rather this blog be a place where I can talk credibly about things I'm interested in and get people interested in my projects. But, despite my best efforts, this blog earned the most money of my projects.

In 2018, this blog receied 568k unique visitors and earned $1.2k in affiliate revenue, which I think is on the low side.

Affiliate revenue: $1243.74
Editing: $XX
Illustrations: $XX
Development: $XX
Hosting: $XX
Net profit: $XX

Is It Keto

Is It Keto is my current focus. For followers of the keto diet, this website gives clear, simple answers about whether particular foods are compatible with the diet.

Affiliate revenue: $1.20
Development: $XX
Hosting: $XX
Net profit: $XX

Space Duck

Space Duck was a project for me to build something on top of Sia. After running some experiments, I decided that Sia was not yet ready to support anything I had in mind, so I moved on.

Income: $0
Logo design: $XX
Development: $XX
Net profit: $XX

Zestful

Zestful was my foray into machine learning. It allowed app developers to take an ingredients like, "1.5 cups finely chopped red onions," and interpret it as structured data: quantity is, "1.5," unit is, "cups," etc. I put the project in maintenance mode in September after several months failing to convince any app developers to use it. Interestingly, several people have approached me in the past few months with plans for using it on new projects, so maybe I can't convince existing apps to switch over, but it appeals to people writing totally new code.

Income: $0
Logo design: $XX
Development: $XX
Hosting: $XX
Net profit: $XX

KetoHub

KetoHub is a project I started last year. It's aggregates keto recipes from different sites and makes them searchable by ingredient. I couldn't find any ways to monetize or grow it without investing a large amount of time, so it's in maintenance mode for now. I occasionally add new features or recipe sources for fun.

Income: $0
User research: $XX
Development: $XX

# I bought a house

While working for Google, I rented an apartment in downtown Manhattan so that I'd be close enough to walk to work. It was $3,300/month, but I didn't care that much because Google paid well and it was worth the quality of life improvement from eliminating a stressful daily commute. After I quit, those factors changed drastically.

Without a stream of income, my time felt constantly metered. Between rent, health insurance, food, and other regular living expenses, my living expenses were $6-7k per month. I was very conscious of the fact that any project I attempted was implicitly a huge investment. Suppose I have a business idea and it takes me three months of work to know whether it's viable. Spending three months working on it would be equivalent to investing $20k in the idea.

One day, I texted my sister jooking that I should buy a cheap house near her in Western Massachussetts. She immediately called me: "Were you joking? Because you should do that for real." The more I thought about it, the more sense it made. It was close to my family, I liked the area, and the cost of living was tiny compared to New York.

So in August, I bought a modest two bedroom house in South Hadley, Massachusetts, population XX.

TODO: House pictures

My living expenses here are $XX per month, which is low enough that I don't have to stress about them too much. It gives me the freedom to try projects like Is It Keto, which has made $1 so far. It will be a long time before it makes enough to cover my expenses, but it's cheap enough to sustain myself that I can basically eliminate that from the equation and think about whether I'm meeting my goals for Is It Keto in terms of user growth and revenue growth.

# Why I'm not consulting

When I talk to other developers about what I'm doing, they often assume that I'm taking on consulting work to make money. But I'm not. And that surprises and confuses them. Do I want consulting work? Why not do consulting work? It's a guaranteed cash inflow as I build my business.

I think what's unique about my position is that I have more in savings than the typical entrepreneur. Based on my current spending, my cost of living roughly matches my returns from savings, so I could do this forever and not run out of money.

So if I don't need the money from consulting, should I still do it? A common theme in stories of successful startups is that they were consulting to pay the bills, but then they recognized some unmet need in their consulting that they could make into a business. And that part of it seems appealing, but my thinking is that even though my businesses are not earning money, I'm hopefully gaining skills at running a business. I don't think anyone is guaranteed to be successful at starting a business. But I hope that by focusing only on my businesses, I'm increasing my chances of being successful.

The wrinkle is that I would take consulting work if the money was absurdly good. But the problem is that from what I understand about consulting, you only talk money after demonstrating to the client how well you can solve the problem. The things I'm known for are code reviews and quitting jobs, neither of which are very easy to translate into ROI for clients. "If your employees stop being obnoxious to each other on code reviews, it will increase your revenues by 30%!" I'm sure in some cases, that statement is true, but it's very hard to prove, and thus very difficult to put my value in dollar terms.

It seems like a nice benefit is that it keeps you connected to real clients and helps you think about what kind of services to offer.

# Having doubts about my skills

I worry about whether I chose a path that makes the worst of my skills. I think my best qualities as a developer was how I think about teams and process. I'm a very thorough code reviewer. I like making sure processes are documented and repeatable. I like writing and reviewing design plans. None of those things are useful as a one-man development team.

# Having doubts about my work

I also have doubts about what I'm working on. My current projects is Is It Keto. It's a website that tells you whether certain foods are compatible with the keto diet. It's one of the least technically complex things I've ever worked on. I have fun working on it, and it's exactly the kind of project I envisioned working on. Each month, I'm attracting more active users and growing revenue. I'm learning new skills in web development and search engine optimization. But I admit that it's embarrassing when people ask me what kind of business I run, and I say it's a directory where people look up whether foods are keto or not.

>**Employee**: My last company was genius. You ever been lost in a parking lot before? ... You would just type in - like what section of the parking lot you're in.<br>
>**Employee**: Right, but this is for your phone
>**Richard**: So, why can't you just write it on a piece of paper?
>**Employee**: Right, but this is for your phone
>**Richard**: So, this is kind of like Notepad?
>Exactly! See you get it!

I  worry about whether I'm taking enough risk. One of my realizations about Zestful was that I was spinning my wheels on busywork to avoid the scary part (TODO: link) where I cold pitch to businesses. Is It Keto notably is a business-to-consumer website, which means I don't have to pitch to anyone. I don't have to convince anyone that using it will make the money.

I made my first dollar of revenue within a week of picking the project up again, so I think there's potential in it, but it's also . It does tick all my boxes of a project. I am growing its traffic measurably month over month, I'm growing its revenue month over month,

I am going to stick with Is It Keto for the time being because it does match a lot of what I find fun about starting a small business:

* I'm making changes that have measurable effect on growth

# Staying motivated

Hasn't been a problem. Biggest problem is knowing when to quit or pivot.

A lot of people have said to me, "Oh, I couldn't work for myself. I'd just watch TV all day." I didn't think that was going to happen, and it hasn't. I do love programming, so that's the thing I do when I'm bored.

A few months in, I did feel not so much unmotivated, but unproductive. And that's when I started writing Snippets. Snippets are a Google thing where, at the end of each week, you write down what you accomplished. It's very free-form. Some people wrote a sentence or two. I wrote bulleted lists. At first I did it to keep my manager informed. Then, I switched managers and my new manager didn't read my snippets, but I realized that they were valuable to me. They were a good way to close out the week.

It's very easy to go a week and feel like nothing got done. That was discouraging. But when I write my snippets, it forces me to look back on my week and recognize how I spent my time. It often turns out that I don't give myself enough credit for what I did. On weeks I feel unproductive, it's often because my memory is lying to me and telling me that interesting accomplishments happened in other weeks.

Other habits have gotten better. I'm much better about not checking my phone, email, and social media constantly.

# I still love it

I dread going back

People ask me if I regret quitting and I definitely do not. Even when I do stress about money, I'd gladly take that over the stress of having to spend my day according to other people's schedules, carrying out tasks that other people choose for me. I really want this to be how I spend the rest of my life.

I love waking up whenever I want. I love that some days I can spontaneously decide it's a vacation day. It's how I want to spend the rest of my life.

# Goals for year two

I've been following another solo developer named Cory Zue. He's fun to watch because he's doing something very similar to what I want. His business is also. But something he did which I'll steal is setting yearly goals.

My goals for 2019:

* Earn $500/month in revenue from my businesses.
* Attract XXk readers to my blog (or just number of articles?)
