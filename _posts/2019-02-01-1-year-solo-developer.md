Today marks a full year of working for myself after quitting my job as a software engineer at Google.

# How I made and spent money

I'll start with money. It's the thing most people are interested in because it's both the strongest motivator and the largest obstacle to starting a business.

{% assign fig_caption = 'Profit and Loss chart via [Bench](http://refer.bench.co/pPrqq).' | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="bench-2018.jpg" alt="Profit and loss for 2018" max_width="793px" class="img-border" img_link="true" fig_caption=fig_caption %}

One way of looking at this chart is that I lost $21k in a single year. A more charitable interpretation is that I grew profits by almost $1k each month.  If this trend continues, I should be fabulously wealthy quite soon.

{% assign fig_caption = 'Profit and loss through 2019, projected' %}

{% include image.html file="2019-projected.jpg" alt="Projected earnings for 2019" max_width="793px" class="img-border" img_link="true" fig_caption=fig_caption %}

Okay, I should have said a more "fanciful" interpretation. The reason that my profits increased (i.e., remained negative, but decreased in magnitude) was that I reduced spending. In April, I had four different part-time developers working for me simultaneously, which was way too much.

The change in my spending also resulted from a significant change in my personal life, which I'll cover a bit later in the post.

# Project by project

## mtlynch.io *(this blog)*

My biggest source of revenue in 2018 was this blog. I deliberately avoid monetizing this blog because I want readers to feel like they're getting high-quality information about topics I care about. I don't want people to wonder if I'm just baiting them to my site so that they can click ads and earn me money. Despite my best efforts, this blog earned more than any of my other projects.

In 2018, this blog receied 981k pageviews and earned $1.2k in affiliate revenue, which I think is on the low side.

| Income/Expense | Amount |
|---------|----------------------|
| Affiliate revenue | $1,244 |
| Editing | $XX |
| Illustrations | $XX |
| Development | $XX |
| [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/?affiliateNetwork=cj&affiliateID=8329872) (Grammar and style checking service) | -$140 | 
| Hosting | -$XX |
| Domain | -$60 |
| **Net profit** | **$XX** |

## [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

Is It Keto is my current focus. It gives readers clear, simple answers about which foods are compatible with the keto diet. If the food is keto-approved, the site displays links where the reader can purchase it online, and the site receives affiliate revenue for the sale. I only began monetizing it at the end of the year, so revenues are small, but I'm hopeful that I can grow them quickly.

| Income/Expense | Amount |
|---------|----------------------|
| Affiliate revenue | $1.20 |
| Development | -$1,660 |
| Hosting | $XX |
| Logo Design | -$211 |
| Domain | -$12 |
| **Net profit** | **$XX** |

## [Space Duck](https://spaceduck.io)

Space Duck was a project for me to build something on top of Sia. After running some experiments, I decided that Sia was not yet ready to support anything I had in mind, so I moved on. I never got to the point of monetizing it.

| Income/Expense | Amount |
|---------|----------------------|
| Logo design | -$250 |
| Website development | -$1,373 |
| Hosting | -$25 |
| Domain | -$60 |
| **Net profit** | -**$1,708** |

## [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com)

Zestful was my foray into machine learning. It allows app developers to take an ingredients like, "1.5 cups finely chopped red onions," and interpret it as structured data: quantity is, "1.5," unit is, "cups," etc. I put the project in maintenance mode in September after several months of [failing to convince any app developers to use it](/shipping-too-late/).

Interestingly, several people have reached out to me in the past few months with plans for using it on new projects, so maybe it will come back to life in 2019.

This was, by far, my most expensive project

| Income/Expense | Amount |
|---------|----------------------|
| Client payments | $0\* |
| Development | -$7,440 |
| Logo design | -$200 |
| Hosting | -$164 |
| Domains | -$50 |
| **Net profit** | **-$7,854** |

\* It *technically* earned about $1 but my payment processor won't pay out amounts less than $2.

## [KetoHub](https://ketohub.io)

KetoHub is a project I started last year. It's aggregates keto recipes from different sites and makes them searchable by ingredient. I couldn't find any ways to monetize or grow it without investing a large amount of time, so it's in maintenance mode for now. I occasionally add new features or recipe sources for fun.

| Income/Expense | Amount |
|---------|----------------------|
| Development | -$1,502 |
| User research| -$220 |
| Logo Design | -$211 |
| Hosting | $XX |
| Domain | -$60 |
| **Net profit** | **$XX** |

## Everything Else

Many of my expenses are for general development or running my business, so they don't fit into a single project.

| Expense | Amount | Note |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| [Bench](http://refer.bench.co/pPrqq) | -$1,610 | Pricy, but worth it. My bookkeepers file everything automatically. I tried free bookkeeping services and they required me to spend hours manually categorizing everything. |
| Travis CI Pro | -$1,419 | I wish this were cheaper, but continuous integration catches so many of my mistakes. |
| Coveralls | -$270 | Another one I wish were cheaper, but I love testing. |
| GitHub Pro | -$91 | Bought this just for the private repos, but [now they're free](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/github-free-users-now-get-unlimited-private-repositories/), so I can stop paying this in 2019. |
| Dev tooling | -$1,400 | I paid freelance developers to add general-purpose tooling during development. |
| Travel, conferences, events, books | -$634 | - |

# I bought a house

While working for Google, I rented an apartment in downtown Manhattan so that I'd be close enough to walk to work. It was $3,300/month, but I didn't care that much because Google paid well and it was worth the quality of life improvement from eliminating a stressful daily commute. After I quit, those factors changed drastically.

Without a stream of income, my time felt constantly metered. Between rent, health insurance, food, and other regular living expenses, my living expenses were $6-7k per month. I was very conscious of the fact that any project I attempted was implicitly a huge investment. Suppose I have a business idea and it takes me three months of work to know whether it's viable. Spending three months working on it would be equivalent to investing $20k in the idea.

One day, I texted my sister jooking that I should buy a cheap house near her in Western Massachussetts. She immediately called me: "Were you joking? Because you should do that for real." The more I thought about it, the more sense it made. It was close to my family, I liked the area, and the cost of living was tiny compared to New York.

So in August, I bought a modest two bedroom house in South Hadley, Massachusetts, population 17,500.

TODO: House pictures

My living expenses here are $XX per month, which is low enough that I don't have to stress about them too much. It gives me the freedom to try projects like Is It Keto, which has made $1 so far. It will be a long time before it makes enough to cover my expenses, but it's cheap enough to sustain myself that I can basically eliminate that from the equation and think about whether I'm meeting my goals for Is It Keto in terms of user growth and revenue growth.

# Staying motivated

When I tell people what I do, they often say, "Oh, I couldn't do that. I'd just watch TV all day." I didn't think that was going to happen, and it hasn't. I like watching TV, but I *love* programming, so the thing that I do when I'm bored is just more programming.

But programming all the time isn't as good a quality as I'm making it out to be. Very few businesses are profitable just by churning out a lot of code. It requires hard work in non-coding areas too like marketing, sales, and strategy. I

I've started writing monthly retrospectives where I take a step back to evaluate what I did and what I need to accomplish next:

* [Zestful: Month 4 - Shipping Too Late](https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/zestful-data-month-4-shipping-too-late-94ac777256)
* [Zestful: Month 5: Launched, but Still No Customers](https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/zestful-data-month-5-launched-but-still-no-customers-32d221561d)
* [Is It Keto: Month 3 - Returning to a Site that Grew without Me](https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/isitketo-returning-to-a-site-that-grew-without-me-0a0fe3ef52)
* [Is It Keto: Month 4 - My First Dollar of Revenue](https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/isitketo-month-4-my-first-dollar-of-revenue-03e572f661)

Outside of work, it's been interesting seeing how my habits have changed now that I have much more control over my time. I've gotten way better at unshackling myself from my phone/email/social media. I've gotten way worse at going to the gym, but I tell myself that all of my yardwork evens it out (it doesn't).

To avoid burnout, I don't work evenings or weekends. I begin working when I wake up, but I almost always stop for the day once I decide to start dinner.

# Why I'm not consulting

People are often surprised to learn that I'm not doing any freelance or consulting work.

The main reason is that I don't need to. Because I purchased a house in an area with a low cost of living, I can sustain myself for several more years just from my savings.

One of my big realizations a few weeks after quitting was that I was [saying yes too much](/since-quitting/#managing-stress). It was hard to make progress on anything when I had several projects running simultaneously. That's my biggest fear with consulting. Because I hear about people who do consulting for one or two months out of the year to cover their expenses, and that sounds nice. But in reality, it's a lot more work to arrange consulting gigs, manage clients, etc. that it's full-time focus a few months out of the year, but it's a constant part time commitment.

# Doubts about my skills

I worry about whether I chose a path that makes the worst of my skills. I think my best qualities as a developer was how I think about teams and process. I'm a very thorough code reviewer. I like making sure processes are documented and repeatable. I like writing and reviewing design plans. None of those things are useful as a one-man development team.

Money is a pretty strong indicator that you're doing the right thing. But it's also a . One thing I keep thinking back to is [this thing](https://twitter.com/shpigford/status/1033032915175858176?lang=en) Josh Pigford posted last year. He now runs BareMetrics, a site that earns over $100k per month in revenue, but he spent 15 years before that on projects that failed,

# Doubts about my work

I also have doubts about what I'm working on. My current projects is Is It Keto. It's a website that tells you whether certain foods are compatible with the keto diet. It's one of the least technically complex things I've ever worked on. I have fun working on it, but I admit that it's embarrassing when people ask me what exciting app I quit Google to work on and my answer is, "Um... You type a food and it tells you whether or not it's keto..."

>**Employee**: My last company was genius. You ever been lost in a parking lot before? ... You would just type in - like what section of the parking lot you're in, like P3 or Ground 7.<br>
>**Richard**: So you just write down what section of the parking lot you're in? I mean - why do you need an app for that?<br>
>**Employee**: So you can remember where you parked.<br>
>**Richard**: Right, but why don't you just write it down on a piece of paper?<br>
>**Employee**: Well, yeah, but this is for your phone.<br>
>**Richard**: Okay, so it's just sort of like Notepad?<br>
>**Employee**: Exactly! See, you get it.

I  worry about whether I'm taking enough risk. One of my realizations about Zestful was that I was [spinning my wheels on busywork to avoid the scary part](/shipping-too-late/#did-i-delay-my-launch-to-avoid-rejection) where I cold pitch to businesses. Is It Keto notably is a business-to-consumer website, which means I don't have to pitch to anyone. I don't have to convince anyone that using it will make the money.

I made my first dollar of revenue within a week of picking the project up again, so I think there's potential in it, but it's also . It does tick all my boxes of a project. I am growing its traffic measurably month over month, I'm growing its revenue month over month,

I am going to stick with Is It Keto for the time being because it does match a lot of what I find fun about starting a small business:

* I'm making changes that have measurable effect on growth

# I still love it

I dread going back

People ask me if I regret quitting and I definitely do not. Even when I do stress about money, I'd gladly take that over the stress of having to spend my day according to other people's schedules, carrying out tasks that other people choose for me. I really want this to be how I spend the rest of my life.

I remember reading books about startups and thinking how fun it would be to make decisions about what part to focus on. Do I focus on user growth or new features? Do I focus on social media or search engine optimization? Now, I'm doing that and it's exactly as fun as I hoped.

I love waking up whenever I want. I love that some days I can spontaneously decide it's a vacation day. It's how I want to spend the rest of my life.

# Goals for year two

I've been following another solo developer named Cory Zue. He's fun to watch because he's doing something very similar to what I want. His business is also. But something he did which I'll steal is setting yearly goals.

My goals for 2019:

* Earn $500/month in revenue from my businesses (averaged over the fourth quarter).
* Attract XXk readers to my blog (or just number of articles?)
