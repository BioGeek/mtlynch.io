I worked as a software engineer for Google from 2014 to 2018. On February 1st, I [quit](/why-i-quit-google/) to form my own single-person software company.

I'm about four months into that, so I thought I'd share how things have been going.

## What's it like not having a job?

That's the most common question people ask. What's it like?

For the first few days, I kept thinking, "Woohoo! I'm free!" It was like starting a long-awaited vacation but and knowing that it could potentially last forever.

Now, it just feels normal. Enjoyable, but normal. So normal, in fact, that it It seems weird to me that I ever had an office job. It's similar to how I feel when I remember high school. "I sat listening to people talk for *six hours a day*? And then I had to do go home and do more work?" I know that it happened, but it seems so foreign to me now.

## Controlling time

The best part of quitting has been how much control I have over my time. I decide my schedule, and there's very little friction if I decide to make changes to it. At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I can just stop working and go for a run. I'm not going to miss a meeting or hold up anyone's work.

A couple months ago, I thought it would be fun to go skiing, so I just... went skiing. On a *Tuesday*. I didn't have to ask anyone's permission, move things around, or re-sync with anyone afterwards. I just wanted to do something fun and then did it.

## Doing things I wouldn't do otherwise

One nice consequence of the above is that I feel more flexible in pursuing opportunities that I wouldn't have otherwise.

I gave my first ever conference presentation. I adapted my post about [code reviews](/human-code-reviews-1/) and presented it at NERD Summit, a very newcomer-friendly conference in Western Massachussets.

A few days later, I received an email from [Stephen Cross](https://twitter.com/stephencross), one of the co-hosts of the [Talking Drupal podcast](http://www.talkingdrupal.com/). He told me that he enjoyed my talk and invited me to [discuss it further on his podcast](http://www.talkingdrupal.com/166). I didn't tell Stephen until we stopped recording, but that was another first for me: I'd never been on a podcast.

Before I quit, so much of my time and mental energy was dedicated to working as an employee that I was very conservative with the remaining time that was mine. There's also a lore more friction and tradeoffs doing these things as an employee. "I still have to meet a deadline in 4 months. Can I afford to lose 2-3 work days? Do I have to get someone's permission to appear on a podcast or preface my remarks by saying that I don't represent my employer?"

Working for myself, those questions go away. I find myself more open to experimentation: trying things I'm not sure I'll enjoy or will benefit me, but are worth trying.

## My quitting blog post

Oddly, my biggest accomplishment since quitting my job has been writing a blog post about quitting my job. If you're reading this post, chances are that you found me because of my February blog post, ["Why I Quit Google to Work for Myself."](/why-i-quit-google/)

I wrote it because I had essentially been writing it in my head for the last nine months of my job. I didn't know what the response would be. I thought people who knew me personally would enjoy reading it to understand why I left what seemed to be a very attractive position at Google. I also thought it might appeal to people who have left Google or other big tech companies for similar reasons.

The response to the post exceeded even my wildest expectations. That week, my blog had over 300,000 unique readers. That's five times as many as my previous most popular post and 600x more visitors than the average day for my blog.

It was surreal not just in the number of visitors but in who was sharing it. David Heinemeier Hansson, creator of Ruby on Rails and author of two books I love, [shared it on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/968966674803130368). So did [Steven Sinofsky](https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/969458227615170560), who was president of Windows when I worked on the Windows team. There were a bunch of other examples, but I think two is about the limit before my shameless name-dropping becomes embarrassing.

## Responding to feedback

The day I published the quitting post, I spent the entire day just responding to emails and comments. It was great! I felt like a celebrity.

The next day, I continued responding to messages. It was still fun, but I didn't feel the same level of euphoria that I felt on day one.

By the third day, I started to feel overwhelmed. I realized that I could spend the next two weeks doing nothing but responding to feedback about my post.

## Letting go

By good fortune, one of the people who reached out to me because of the blog post was Stephanie Hurlburt. She's the founder of a [successful graphics startup](http://www.binomial.info/) and is well-known on Twitter for sharing useful advice for other founders.

Knowing that Stephanie must deal with an insurmountable mountain of messages at all times, I asked her how she manages it. She gave me this excellent advice:

>...it is 100% okay to take a month or more to respond to someone, and expect a response back. It is even okay to take a year to respond to someone, but maybe don't expect a response back then (they've probably moved on to other things). So in other words, you don't need to tackle every message as it comes in, you can have a day a month where you just power through them.
>
>-Stephanie Hurlburt ([@sehurlburt](https://twitter.com/sehurlburt))

It sounds simple, but this was very freeing. I had felt this need to get back to everyone in a timely manner. After I spoke to Stephanie, I felt like I had permission to take my time. I resumed the projects I was working on but would add an item to my daily to-do list: "Respond to five emails," or "Respond to 20 twitter DMs."

**Sidenote**: Stephanie *said*  it was okay to delay responses for a month, but she wrote me a very thoughtful three-paragraph reply a few minutes after I asked her my question. It's possible that she's tricking me so that she can maintain her position as the most helpful person on Twitter.

Stephanie also recommended that I accept the fact that I can't respond to every message, so I need to define what criteria that determines . What I was doing was unsystematically looking at all my unanswered messages and deciding which to answer next. But that meant repeatedly looking at the same messages even if it was .

Will this lead to a conversation I'm interested in having?
Is the person offering me something that I value?

## Managing stress

Before I quit, I kept hearing stories about how founding even a small business comes with a lot of stress. I thought, "I'm sure that's true but I'm going to be spending every day in my pajamas. How stressed will I really be?"

{% include image.html file="so-stressed.png" alt="The stresses of my daily life after quitting my job" max_width="750px" img_link=true %}

But they were right. I did feel stress. Not about things that I thought people stressed about like money or customers. I was just stressing about deadlines I set for myself that nobody else cared about or even knew existed. I felt more anxious about my self-imposed deadlines than I ever did about deadlines at my actual job.

While I was an employee, my vision of self-employment was one where I'd have unlimited time. The eight hours a day I was spending in the office felt like an eternity. Therefore, if I cut those out, I'd have eternal *free* time.

As a result, I committed to more projects than I should have. I kept saying yes to offers because who doesn't like saying yes? But after a few weeks, I realized that I had taken on so many projects that I stopped making meaningful progress on any of them.

It took me a few weeks to gracefully complete my obligations, all the while saying "no" to everyone who approached me with new stuff.

Since then, I've felt less stressed about deadlines, but I'm experiencing a different kind of stress, which I'll call "enthusiasm stress." I get so excited about whatever I'm working on that I just shut out everything else. I stop planning to see friends, and I can't fall asleep because my thoughts are too consumed with what code I want to write tomorrow.

I think I'm coming around to a solution for this as well. Meditation and to-do lists.

## Failed project: Space Duck

For the past two years, I've contributed to and [written frequently](/tags/#sia) about a decentralized storage project called Sia.

It was an obvious choice for my post-Google focus. One of its main value propositions is that it allows users to store and transfer data at much cheaper rates than providers like Amazon or Google.

Sia is still pretty obscure. Not many people understand how to use it, so nobody had built any real services on top of it yet. But I understood it. Maybe I could find a business whose main cost is storage or data transfer and just build the Sia-powered version of that. TODO: find an example of a company who spends a ton on bandwidth.

I also liked writing about Sia. I thought that could either continue blogging about Sia and use it to attract customers to whatever service I was building. Or maybe writing about Sia and decentralized storage technology would be lucrative in itself.

{% include image.html file="space-duck-logo.png" alt="Space Duck logo" max_width="750px" link_url="https://blog.spaceduck.io" %}

I began with an exploratory project to measure Sia's capacity and costs. Sia claimed that it was 1/10th the cost of Amazon, but nobody had ever measured this in practice. With Amazon, you get a bill at the end of the month, and that's your cost. Because Sia is decentralized, there's no single company to send you a bill. Instead, the software automatically makes dozens of tiny contracts with anonymous hosts. It's difficult to untangle all the data to figure out what you actually paid. Nobody ever had the combination of time, motivation, and knowledge to do it. But as a Sia enthusiast who just quit his job, I realized that person was me.

Unfortunately, the results of the test were disappointing. I concluded that Sia was [not as cheap as everyone thought](https://blog.spaceduck.io/load-test-wrapup/#storage-isnt-that-cheap). Worse, I encountered [so many bugs](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+author%3Amtlynch+) during basic usage that received so little attention from the core developers that I realized this wasn't the horse I should hitch my wagon to.

The blogging part wasn't working out either. I probably had ~100% market share of people interested in technical blog posts about Sia. Unforutnately, that population is about 40 people.

It was a hobby, but I was dedicating a job-level amount of time to it.

## Understanding ingredients

Last year, I [created](https://mtlynch.io/outsourcing-mvp/) an aggregator / search tool for recipes that fit the keto diet. One of its key features is that it allows users to search recipes by ingredient. So if you have ground beef you'd like to cook, you can search ["ground beef"](https://ketohub.io/?q=%22ground%20beef%22) and find all the keto-friendly recipes you can use.

This is a bit tricky because you'll notice that KetoHub displays the ingredient as plain "Ground beef" but the site where I pulled the recipe actually shows "1 pound of ground beef." For search purposes, the "1 pound of" is irrelevant. Nobody's ever going to say, "I've got a hankering to cook a meal, and I don't care what it is as long as it involves *a pound* of something.'"

At first I solved this with some simple rules. For example, "throw away units of measurement" But it wasn't long before I ran into edge cases. "Dash" is an informal unit of measurement ("a dash of cinnamon"), but then there's also a popular seasoning called [Mrs. Dash](https://amzn.to/2Ks05bh). Okay, so throw away "dash" unless it's preceded by "Mrs." But then there are some sites that are perhaps rejected the sexist baggaged attached to the "Mrs." prefix and shortened the name to "Ms. Dash."

{% include image.html file="ms-dash.png" alt="Recipe mistakenly uses name Ms. Dash" max_width="726px" link_url="https://www.ruled.me/low-carb-corndogs/" %}

All the rules followed that path. They start out simple, but then after enough tweaks to handle variations and edge cases, they become more complex and conflict with other rules. Every time I added a new site to KetoHub, I had to spend several hours juggling rules to handle the new site's idiosyncracies without breaking any of the old rules.

## Ingredient parsing as a service

Early in KetoHub's life, a commenter on Indie Hackers [showed me](https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/ketohub-month-2-report-1229ddb803?commentId=-L-clmWeoqUnFcAzTi5t) a blog post about how *The New York Times* [used machine learning](https://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/extracting-structured-data-from-recipes-using-conditional-random-fields/) to parse ingredients from their historical archive of recipes.

That sounded neat, but it would be overkill for my little recipe aggregator site. The *Times* published their code, but it looked like it would be a few days of work to even get it up and running. I couldn't justify spending time on it because none of my users had ever raised concerns about search accuracy, and I wasn't even sure the machine learning solution would be more accurate or less maintenance than my kludgey rule-based strategy.

Then I had a realization: What if ingredient parsing *is* the business?

KetoHub was a fun project, but I still hadn't found a good way to monetize it. If parsing ingredients was a problem for KetoHub, maybe it was a problem for other websites and mobile apps.

It might seem like the kind of thing you could have an in-house developer spend a few days solving, but developers are expensive. The cost of a good developer for just a week is probably in the tens of thousands of dollars. If business owners could instead pay me only *hundreds* of dollars for my easy-to-use service, everybody wins.

Granted, I'm not the first person to think of this. There are recipe parsing services that exist already, but they're not great. When I was originally searching for a solution for this problem, I evaluated the existing options and found that they were either wildly inaccurate or had such burdensome licensing terms that they weren't worth buying.

I spent a few weeks going down the rabbit hole of ingredients and machine learning, and I now have a [demo](https://ingredientparser.com) that works pretty well:

If you're a developer who wants to make your apps understand ingredients better or you're a user of an app that might benefit from this service, let's talk. Shoot me an email at [michael@mtlynch.io](mailto:michael@mtlynch.io).
