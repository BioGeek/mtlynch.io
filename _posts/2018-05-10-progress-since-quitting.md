## Blogging about quitting

## Blogging about Sia

The area I've spent the most time is Sia. I started a blog to talk about my experiemnts with Sia. When I started it, I was still exploring how I could make money with Sia. Maybe I build a service on top of Sia. Maybe I could make money by just doing experiments and writing about them.

The first step was to write a load test for Sia. Nobody had ever done one before, but I needed to see concrete numbers before I built any sort of business on Sia. It seemed simple enough. I wrote upa  test plan and figured it would take about twoo weeks from start to finish.

An investor heard about it and offered to pay me to run these tests. Wow, lucky deal! Someone wants to pay me for somehting I was going to do anyway for free.

Maybe they don't really know what developers make, so they were going to offer me $500/week. Maybe they have millions of dollars invested in this coind and wouldn't flinch at $20k/week.

I figured I'd just do it for free and if he valued quality software, they'd see I wasn't just some random guy slapping together some awful junk code, but was producing code that was documented, tested, and well-factored.

## Figuring out what I want

My ultimate goal is a business that:

* Earns me an income that lets me maintain my current lifestyle and eventually lets me start a family
* I either love working on it and/or I can keep working to minimize the amount of time I spend actively working on it
* It's mine

I thought about whether I'd prefer to end the year with $80k in consulting earnings or $100/month from a business I built. I'd prefer the $100/month. I like thinking about changes I can make to increase retention or changes to pricing to affect profit.

## Stressing about deadlines

I was more stressed about deadlines than when I actually had deadlines. I realized that I committed to too many things. I had this idea before I quit that once I didn't have day job, I'd have unlimited time.

"Oh no! I have to finish that blog post while it still feels fresh and relevant!"

## Having adventures

* Gave my first conference talk
* Made my first podcast appearance
* Played a computer game from beginning to end for the first time in 15 years
* Madea n April Fool's Day video
* Published a Docker image that has XX pulls
* Discovered a neat login bypass vulnerability and reported it to the vendor (public disclosure hopefully ready in a few weeks)

## Struggling to recall office work

## Narrowing my focus

I have really passionate fans of Space Duck, but the problem is that there are like 30 of them total. It's the obvious cut. it has XX% of the newsletter subscribers, gets XX% of the visitors.

But it's so fun... It's the subject I'm top 10 most knowledgeable in the world about. There are only like 30 people who *want* to beknowledgeable in it, but still.

I keep thinking, "One more experiment..."
