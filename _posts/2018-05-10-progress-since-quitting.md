I worked as a software engineer for Google from 2014 to 2018. On February 1st, I [quit](/why-i-quit-google/) to form my own single-person software company.

I'm about four months into that, so I thought I'd share an update about how things are going.

## What's it like not having a job?

That's the most common question people ask. What's it like?

For the first few days, I kept thinking, "Woohoo! I'm free!" It was like starting a long-awaited vacation and knowing that it could potentially last forever.

Now, it just feels normal. Enjoyable, but normal. So normal, in fact, that it seems weird to me that I ever had an office job. It's similar to how I feel when I remember high school. "I sat listening to people talk for *six hours a day*? And then I had to do go home and do more work?" I know that it happened, but it seems so foreign to me now.

The best part of quitting has been how much control I have over my time. I structure my day however I want, and there's very little friction if I make changes to it. If I feel like going for a run at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I can just go for a run. I'm not going to miss a meeting or hold up anyone's work.

## Doing things I wouldn't do otherwise

Because I have so much more time that's my own, I find myself more willing to experiment and pursue opportunities that I wouldn't have otherwise.

I gave my first ever conference presentation. I adapted my favorite post from the blog, ["How to Do Code Reviews Like a Human,"](/human-code-reviews-1/) and presented it at NERD Summit, a newcomer-friendly conference in Western Massachussetts.

A few days later, I received an email from [Stephen Cross](https://twitter.com/stephencross), one of the co-hosts of the [Talking Drupal podcast](http://www.talkingdrupal.com/). He told me that he enjoyed my talk and invited me to [discuss it further on his podcast](http://www.talkingdrupal.com/166).

It was a fun conversation because my experience with code reviews has mainly been at large software companies, and the hosts had different experiences with code reviews from participating as external contractors or within small firms. I didn't tell Stephen until we stopped recording, but that was another first for me: I'd never been on a podcast.

## My quitting blog post

Oddly, my biggest accomplishment since quitting my job has been... writing a blog post about quitting my job. If you're reading this, chances are that you found my blog because of my February post, ["Why I Quit Google to Work for Myself,"](/why-i-quit-google/). It attracted 300,000 readers in its first week, dwarfing my previous top posts by 6x.

The day I published it, I spent the entire day just responding to emails, comments, and Twitter messages about the posts. It was great! I felt like a celebrity.

The next day, I continued responding to messages. It was a little less fun than the first day, but still a definite high from seeing the size of the response.

By the third day, I started to feel overwhelmed. I realized that I could spend the next two weeks doing nothing but responding to feedback about my post. People kept asking what I'd been working on post-Google. What was I going to say? "Well, I've primarily been focused on getting a quick dopamine hits from my notifications about this post."

## Managing feedback

One of the people who reached out to me was Stephanie Hurlburt. She's the founder of a [successful graphics startup](http://www.binomial.info/) and is well-known in the startup community for her insightful [blog posts](http://stephaniehurlburt.com/blog-archive/) and [Twitter threads](https://twitter.com/sehurlburt).

She sent me a very nice message about the post and told me she was available if I needed any advice. This was great because she was just the person whose advice I needed. She must receive tons of messages every week, so I asked her how she manages it.

>...it is 100% okay to take a month or more to respond to someone, and expect a response back. It is even okay to take a year to respond to someone, but maybe don't expect a response back then (they've probably moved on to other things). So in other words, you don't need to tackle every message as it comes in, you can have a day a month where you just power through them.

>-Stephanie Hurlburt ([@sehurlburt](https://twitter.com/sehurlburt)

Her advice might sound simple, but I found it very freeing. I typically respond to people in a day or two, so having a backlog of hundreds of messages and emails made me feel like I was constantly behind.

After I spoke to Stephanie, I felt like I had permission to take my time. I resumed the projects I was working on but would add an item to my daily to-do list for a defined chunk of catching up like "reply to five emails" or "answer 20 Twitter DMs."

**Sidenote**: Stephanie *said*  it was okay to delay responses for a month, but she wrote me a very thoughtful three-paragraph reply a few minutes after I asked her my question. It's possible that she's tricking me so that she can maintain her position as the most helpful person on Twitter.

Stephanie also recommended that I accept the reality that there are too many messages and some have to remain unanswered. I still feel guilty about not answering every message, but I found that it became much easier to let some messages go after I got out of the mindset of prompt responses for every message. Messages from two weeks ago feel a bit more detached, and it's easier to think, "Well, this person has probably lived their life just fine in the two." Setting limits on my correspondence also helps with this, where I can see a message and think, "I'd like to respond to this, but I'm limiting myself to five reader emails today, and this isn't in my top five."

## Managing stress

Before I quit, I kept hearing stories about how founding even a small business comes with a lot of stress. I thought, "I'm sure that's true, but I'm going to be spending every day in my pajamas. How stressed will I really be?"

{% include image.html file="so-stressed.png" alt="The stresses of my daily life after quitting my job" max_width="750px" img_link=true %}

But they were right. I did feel stress. Not about things they warned me about like money or customers. I was stressing about deadlines I set for myself that nobody else cared about. I felt more anxious about my self-imposed deadlines than I ever did about deadlines at Google.

While I was an employee, my vision of self-employment was one where I'd have unlimited time. The eight hours a day I spent in the office felt like an eternity. Therefore, if I cut those out, I'd have eternal *free* time.

It turns out that outside work, people are still limited to the standard 24 hours a day. Before I realized that, I committed to more projects than I should have. I kept saying yes to opportunities because each one seemed small in isolation. After a few weeks, I realized that I had taken on so many little tasks that I wasn't making meaningful progress on any of them.

It took me a few weeks to gracefully complete my obligations, all the while saying "no" to everyone who approached me with new stuff, but once I did, I felt a lot better. I still set deadlines for myself, but I stricly limited the number of ongoing projects I take on.

## Failed project: Space Duck

For the past two years, I've contributed to and [written frequently](/tags/#sia) about a decentralized storage project called Sia.

Its main value proposition is that it commoditizes data storage, driving prices down. It promises to allow users to store and transfer data for 1/10th of what it would cost on Amazon or Google. It's still under the radar because very few people understand how to use it, much less build services on top of it.

I was one of only a few dozen people who understood it at a deep enough level to build software that used it. If I could build a product in a space that's typically limited by bandwidth or storage (e.g., data backup/recovery, video streaming), I could have a huge advantage over competitors whose infrastructure costs are 10x higher than Sia's.

I didn't know what my business would do, but I started a dedicated blog about Sia to build interest in whatever I decided to make. I started a blog called [Space Duck](https://blog.spaceduck.io/) as a dedicated site for me to blog about Sia and my experiences building on top of it.

{% include image.html file="space-duck-logo.png" alt="Space Duck logo" max_width="750px" link_url="https://blog.spaceduck.io" %}

Unfortunately, my early testing revealed that Sia was [not as cheap as everyone thought](https://blog.spaceduck.io/load-test-wrapup/#storage-isnt-that-cheap). Worse, I encountered a worryingly [high number of bugs](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+author%3Amtlynch+) during basic usage, many of which went ignored by the core dev team.

I decided Sia wasn't the star I should hitch my wagon to, so I demoted my Sia experiments back to the level of "hobby" and turned my attention to projects I thought could become profitable businesses.

## Back to KetoHub

Last year, I [created](https://mtlynch.io/outsourcing-mvp/) an aggregator / search tool for recipes that fit the keto diet. One of its key features is that it allows users to search recipes by ingredient. So if you have ground beef you'd like to cook, you can search ["ground beef"](https://ketohub.io/?q=%22ground%20beef%22) and find all the keto-friendly recipes you can use.

{% include image.html file="1-lb-ground-beef.png" alt="Screenshot of KetoHub results for ground beef" max_width="800px" img_link=true %}

KetoHub displays the ingredient as simply "Ground beef," but the original source said, "1 pound of ground beef." For search purposes, the "1 pound of" is irrelevant. Nobody ever thinks, "I've got a hankering to cook a meal. I don't care what it is as long as it involves *a pound* of something."

At first I discarded the irrelevant words using simple rules. An obvious early rule was, "throw away units of measurement." That works for "tablespoon" and "teaspoon," but what about "dash"? It's an informal unit of measurement ("a dash of cinnamon"), but there's also a popular seasoning called [Mrs. Dash](https://amzn.to/2Ks05bh). Okay, so throw away "dash" unless it's preceded by "Mrs."

Oh, wait. One perhaps progressive-minded recipe author apparently decided that Mrs. Dash shouldn't reveal her marital status in her product's name, so he refers to her as "Ms. Dash."

{% include image.html file="ms-dash.png" alt="Recipe mistakenly uses name Ms. Dash" max_width="726px" link_url="https://www.ruled.me/low-carb-corndogs/" %}

This is the nature of rules for processing unstructured web data. They start out simple, but after enough tweaks to handle variations and edge cases, they become more complex and begin to conflict with each other. Every time I added a new recipe source to KetoHub, I had to spend several hours juggling rules so that KetoHub could handle the new site's idiosyncracies without breaking any of the existing rules.

## New project: Ingredient parsing as a service

Early in KetoHub's life, a commenter on Indie Hackers [showed me](https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/ketohub-month-2-report-1229ddb803?commentId=-L-clmWeoqUnFcAzTi5t) a blog post about how *The New York Times* [used machine learning](https://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/extracting-structured-data-from-recipes-using-conditional-random-fields/) to parse ingredients from their historical archive of recipes.


{% assign fig_caption = "Visualization of *The New York Times*' ingredient parser results" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="nyt-parser.png" alt="Visualization of New York Times results" max_width="509px" fig_caption=fig_caption %}

That sounded neat, but it would be overkill for my little recipe aggregator site. None of my users had ever noticed inaccuracies in search, so I couldn't justify spending several days trying to replicate the *NY Times*' results.

Then I had a realization: What if ingredient parsing *is* the business?

KetoHub was a fun project, but I still hadn't found a good way to monetize it. If parsing ingredients was a problem for KetoHub, maybe it was a problem for other websites and mobile apps focused on cooking and nutrition.

I spent a few weeks with my freelancer friend, [Ferngully](/outsourcing-mvp/#finding-a-freelancer), going down the rabbit hole of machine learning, and now we have a [working demo](https://ingredientparser.com):

{% include image.html file="parser-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of Ingredient Parser demo" max_width="800px" link_url="https://ingredientparser.com/" %}

If you're a developer with an app that needs to understand ingredients or you know of one that does, let's talk. Shoot me an email at [michael@mtlynch.io](mailto:michael@mtlynch.io) or [sign up for Ingredient Parser API updates](http://eepurl.com/dvGy_b).
