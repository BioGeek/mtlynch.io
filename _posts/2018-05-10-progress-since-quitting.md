I worked as a software engineer for Google from 2014 to 2018. On February 1st, I [quit](/why-i-quit-google/) to form my own single-person software company.

I'm about four months into that, so I thought I'd share an update about how things are going.

## What's it like not having a job?

That's the most common question people ask. What's it like?

For the first few days, I kept thinking, "Woohoo! I'm free!" It was like starting a long-awaited vacation and knowing that it could potentially last forever.

Now, it just feels normal. Enjoyable, but normal. It seems weird to me that I ever had an office job. It's similar to how I feel when I remember high school. "I sat listening to people talk for *six hours a day*? And then I had to do go home and do more work?" I know that it happened, but it seems so foreign to me now.

The best part of quitting has been how much control I have over my time. I structure my day however I want, and there's very little friction if I make changes to it. If I feel like going for a run at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I can just go for a run. I'm not going to miss a meeting or hold up anyone's work.

## Doing things I wouldn't do otherwise

Because I have so much more time that's my own, I find myself more willing to experiment and pursue opportunities that I wouldn't have when I was an employee.

I gave my first ever conference presentation. I adapted my favorite post from the blog, ["How to Do Code Reviews Like a Human,"](/human-code-reviews-1/) and presented it at NERD Summit, a newcomer-friendly conference in Western Massachusetts.

A few days later, I received an email from [Stephen Cross](https://twitter.com/stephencross), one of the co-hosts of the [Talking Drupal podcast](http://www.talkingdrupal.com/). He enjoyed my talk and invited me to [discuss it further on his podcast](http://www.talkingdrupal.com/166). We had a fun conversation and thought about reviews from angles I had never considered before. I didn't tell Stephen until we stopped recording, but that podcast episode was another big first for me: my first ever podcast appearance.

## My quitting blog post

Oddly, my biggest accomplishment since quitting my job has been... writing a blog post about quitting my job. If you're reading this, chances are that you found my blog because of my February post, ["Why I Quit Google to Work for Myself,"](/why-i-quit-google/). It attracted 300,000 readers in its first week, dwarfing my previous top posts by 6x.

When the post went live, I spent the entire day just responding to emails, comments, and Twitter messages. It was great! I felt like a celebrity.

The next day, I continued responding to messages. It was a little less fun than the first day, but I still felt a high from seeing the the compliments and encouragement.

By the third day, I started to feel overwhelmed. I realized that I could spend the next two weeks doing nothing but responding to feedback about my post. People kept asking what I'd been working on post-Google. What was I going to say? "Well, I've primarily been focused on getting quick dopamine hits from seeing new notifications from this post."

## Managing feedback

One of the people who reached out to me was Stephanie Hurlburt. She's the founder of a [successful graphics startup](http://www.binomial.info/) and is well-known in the startup community for her insightful [blog posts](http://stephaniehurlburt.com/blog-archive/) and [Twitter threads](https://twitter.com/sehurlburt).

She sent me a very nice message about the post and offered her availability if I ever wanted advice. This really lucky for me because Stephanie was just the person who could help me with my feedback overload. I see people publicly asking her questions a lot, so I suspected she must receive a lot of private messages, and I asked her how she handles the volume. With her permission, I've included part of her answer below:

>...it is 100% okay to take a month or more to respond to someone, and expect a response back. It is even okay to take a year to respond to someone, but maybe don't expect a response back then (they've probably moved on to other things). So in other words, you don't need to tackle every message as it comes in, you can have a day a month where you just power through them.
>
>-Stephanie Hurlburt ([@sehurlburt](https://twitter.com/sehurlburt)

Her advice might sound simple, but I found it very freeing. I typically respond to people in a day or two, so having a backlog of hundreds of messages and emails made me feel like I was constantly behind.

After I spoke to Stephanie, I felt like I had permission to take my time. I shifted my focus back to my software projects, but every few days, I'd set aside time to answer some fixed amount of messages like five emails or 10 Twitter messages.

**Sidenote**: Stephanie *said*  it was okay to delay responses for a month, but she wrote me a very thoughtful three-paragraph reply within minutes of my question. It's possible that she's tricking me so that she can maintain her position as the most helpful person on Twitter.

Stephanie also pointed out that it's not practical to respond to every single message. I still feel guilty when I ignore an email, but I found that getting out of the mindset of prompt responses helped me detach a bit and make rational choices about which messages to answer. For example, if someone writes me with questions about [finding a blog cartoonist](/how-to-hire-a-cartoonist/), that's fun for me to talk about because not many bloggers work with cartoonists. I'll answer that email ahead of one that asks me more general questions about geting hired at Google.

## Managing stress

Before I quit, I kept hearing stories about how founding even a small business causes severe stress. I thought, "I'm sure that's true for *them*, but I'm going to be spending every day in my pajamas. How stressed will I really be?"

{% include image.html file="so-stressed.png" alt="The stresses of my daily life after quitting my job" max_width="750px" img_link=true %}

But they were right. I did feel stress. Not about the things they warned me about like money or customers. I was stressing about deadlines I set for myself that nobody else cared about. My self-imposed deadlines gave me more anxiety than any external deadline I ever had at Google.

While I was an employee, I imagined that self-employment would give me unlimited time. The eight hours a day I spent in the office felt like an eternity. If I cut those out, I'd have eternal *free* time.

It turns out that outside Google, people are still limited to the standard 24 hours per day. But I kept saying yes to new opportunities because each one seemed small in isolation. After a few weeks, I realized that I had taken on so many little tasks that I wasn't making meaningful progress on any of them.

I'm now much more conservative about taking on projects. Even if they seem small or require little effort from me, simply keeping context and communicating about it requires significant time and mental energy. These days, I limit my focus to this blog and one software project (spoiler alert: they end up intertwining).

## Failed project: Space Duck

My first business idea after quitting was to build a service on top of Sia, a decentralized storage platform I've contributed to and [written about frequently](/tags/#sia).

Sia's goal is to make data storage a commodity that anyone can sell. It promises prices that are 1/10th of Amazon or Google rates. The technology is still under the radar because very few people understand how to use it, much less build services on top of it.

I was one of only a few dozen people who understood it at a deep enough level to build a business on the Sia platform. If I could build a product in a space that's typically limited by bandwidth or storage (e.g., data backup/recovery, video streaming), I could have a huge advantage over competitors whose infrastructure costs are 10x higher.

I didn't know exactly what I wanted to build, but one way I wanted to attract users was through a company blog that discussed technical aspects of Sia that nobody else was writing about. I created a blog called Space Duck and started writing about my exploratory tests of Sia's capabilities.

I didn't know what my business would do, but I started a dedicated blog about Sia to build interest in whatever I decided to make. I started a blog called [Space Duck](https://blog.spaceduck.io/) as a dedicated site for me to blog about Sia and my experiences building on top of it.

{% include image.html file="space-duck-logo.png" alt="Space Duck logo" max_width="750px" link_url="https://blog.spaceduck.io" %}

Unfortunately, these tests revealed that Sia was [not as cheap as everyone thought](https://blog.spaceduck.io/load-test-wrapup/#storage-isnt-that-cheap). At Sia's true price point, there were providers with much more stable, feature-rich offerings. Without any practical advantages over other storage providers, Sia was a dead end.

## KetoHub's ingredient problem

I turned my attention back to [KetoHub](https://mtlynch.io/outsourcing-mvp/), a website I created last year to aggregate recipes that fit the keto diet.

KetoHub allows users to search by ingredient, so if you have ground beef you'd like to cook, you can search ["ground beef"](https://ketohub.io/?q=%22ground%20beef%22) and find all the keto-friendly meals you can make with it:

{% include image.html file="1-lb-ground-beef.png" alt="Screenshot of KetoHub results for ground beef" max_width="800px" img_link=true %}

Ingredients have extra information that's irrelevant for searches. The ingredient appeared as "1 pound ground beef," but KetoHub reduced the search result to "Ground beef."

It's harder than it looks to decide automatically which part of the ingredient is relevant. My initial solution relied on defining rules. One rule was, "throw away units of measurement." If someone types "tab," they're probably looking for "**Tab**asco" and not every ingredient that happens to have a "**tab**lespoon" of something. But what about "dash"? It's an informal unit of measurement ("a dash of cinnamon"), but there's also a popular seasoning called [Mrs. Dash](https://amzn.to/2Ks05bh). Okay, so throw away "dash" unless it's preceded by "Mrs."

Oh, wait. That rule doesn't always work because one recipe author perhaps felt that Mrs. Dash's marital status was nobody else's business, so he referred to the seasoning as "*Ms.* Dash."

{% include image.html file="ms-dash.png" alt="Recipe mistakenly uses name Ms. Dash" max_width="726px" link_url="https://www.ruled.me/low-carb-corndogs/" %}

This is the nature of applying strict rules to random web data. They start out simple, but after enough variations and edge cases, they increase in complexity and conflict with each other.

Every time I added a new recipe source to KetoHub, I had to spend several hours juggling rules so that KetoHub could handle the new site's idiosyncracies without breaking any of the existing rules.

I needed a more flexible way for KetoHub to process ingredients.

## New project: Ingredient parsing as a service

Early in KetoHub's life, a commenter on Indie Hackers [showed me](https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/ketohub-month-2-report-1229ddb803?commentId=-L-clmWeoqUnFcAzTi5t) a blog post about how *The New York Times* [used machine learning](https://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/extracting-structured-data-from-recipes-using-conditional-random-fields/) to parse ingredients from their historical archive of recipes.

{% assign fig_caption = "Visualization of *The New York Times*' ingredient parser results" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="nyt-parser.png" alt="Visualization of New York Times results" max_width="509px" fig_caption=fig_caption %}

That sounded neat, but felt like overkill my little recipe aggregator site. It would be like buying an original Picasso because you wanted to hide the scratch you made in your studio apartment. It would indeed solve the problem, but it's a bit overboard. That particular piece would be bigger than the whole.

Then I had a realization: What if ingredient parsing *is* the business?

KetoHub was a fun project, but I still hadn't found a good way to monetize it. If parsing ingredients was a problem for KetoHub, maybe it was a problem for other websites and mobile apps.

I asked my freelancer friend, [Ferngully](/outsourcing-mvp/#finding-a-freelancer) to begin experimenting with the *NY Times* process. When it looked like it would be viable, we spent a few weeks together going down the machine learning rabbit hole.

Now we have a [working demo](https://ingredientparser.com)! Try giving it recipe ingredients like `1 1/2 cups chopped red onions` or `2 tablespoons minced parsley`. It will break the ingredient down into its component parts:

{% include image.html file="parser-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of Ingredient Parser demo" max_width="800px" link_url="https://ingredientparser.com/" %}

If you're a developer with an app that needs to understand ingredients or you know of one that does, let's talk. Shoot me an email at [michael@mtlynch.io](mailto:michael@mtlynch.io) or [sign up for Ingredient Parser API updates](http://eepurl.com/dvGy_b).
