I worked as a software engineer for Google from 2014 to 2018. I quit my job (TODO: link) on Feb. 1st, so I've now been working on my own for almost four months.

## What's it like not having a job?

That's the most common question people ask. What's it like?

For the first few days, I felt like, "Woohoo! I'm free!" It was like starting a long-awaited vacation, but one that would potentially last forever.

Now, it just feels normal. Enjoyable, but normal.

It seems weird to me that I ever had an office job. It's similar to how I feel when I remember high school. "I sat listening to people talk for *six hours a day*? And then I had to do go home and do more work?" I know that it happened, but it seems so foreign to me now.

## The gift of time

The best part of quitting has been how much control I have over my time. At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I can just stop working and go for a run. I'm not going to miss a meeting or hold up anyone's work.

A couple months ago, I thought it would be fun to go skiing, so I just... went skiing. On a *Tuesday*. I didn't have to ask anyone's permission, move things around, or re-sync with anyone when I got back. I just wanted to do something fun and then did it.

## New opportunities

One very nice consequence of my time flexibility is that it's given me flexibility to pursue opportunities that I wouldn't have pursued if I kept my office job.

I gave my first ever conference presentation. I adapted my post about [code reviews](/human-code-reviews-1/) and presented it at NERD Summit, a very newcomer-friendly conference in Western Massachussets.

A few days later, I received an email from [Stephen Cross](https://twitter.com/stephencross), one of the co-hosts of the [Talking Drupal podcast](http://www.talkingdrupal.com/). He told me that he enjoyed my talk and wanted to know if I'd be interested in having a discussion about it on his podcast. We had a [fun, interesting discussion](http://www.talkingdrupal.com/166). I didn't tell Stephen until we stopped recording that it was the first time I'd ever been on a podcast.

In the not-work space, I played a computer game from start to finish for the first time in 15 years. When I had an office job, I'd start two or three games per year but never finish them because I felt pressure to invest more time into either my job or my side projects.

## My quitting blog post

Oddly, my biggest accomplishment since quitting my job has been writing a blog post about quitting my job. If you're reading this post, chances are that you found me because of my February blog post, "Why I Quit Google to Work for Myself."

It took me a long time to write. I wrote for 4-6 hours each week for two months. I kept writing parts and then throwing them away for one reason or another. I wanted it to be thorough but not whiny. Highlighting issues but not throwing people under the bus. I kept writing it and rewriting it and finally set a hard deadline for myself of Feb. 28th so that it was the same month I quit so that it would still feel fresh and relevant.

I didn't know what the response would be. I thought people who knew me personally would enjoy reading it to understand why I left what seemed to be a very attractive position at Google. I also thought it might appeal to people who have left Google or other big tech companies for similar reasons.

The response to the post exceeded even my wildest expectations. That week, my blog had over 300,000 unique readers. That's five times as many as my previous most popular post and 600x more visitors than the average day for my blog.

It was surreal not just in the number of visitors but in who was sharing it. David Hanselman-Heyer, whose books I read. Patrick McKenzie. Steven Sinofsky, who was president of It was a bit surreal. I saw people sharing it on Twitter whose books I'd read or whose essays I'd followed for years.

## Responding to feedback

The day I published the quitting post, I spent the entire day just responding to emails and comments. It was great! I felt like a celebrity.

The next day, I continued responding to messages. It was still fun, but I didn't feel the same level of euphoria that I felt on day one.

By the third day, I started to feel overwhelmed. I realized that I could spend the next two weeks doing nothing but responding to feedback about my post.

## Letting go

One of the people who reached out after the blog post was Stephanie Hurlburt. She co-founded a successful graphics startup, and is well-known on Twitter for sharing useful advice for startup founders. I followed her on Twitter and was delighted and surprised that she sent me a message in response to my article, unpromptedly offering to help me with my plans if I needed it.

I realized that Stephanie must deal with an oversupply of messages all the time. How did she deal with it? I asked her, and she gave me this excellent advice:

>...it is 100% okay to take a month or more to respond to someone, and expect a response back. It is even okay to take a year to respond to someone, but maybe don't expect a response back then (they've probably moved on to other things). So in other words, you don't need to tackle every message as it comes in, you can have a day a month where you just power through them.
>
>-Stephanie Hurlburt ([@sehurlburt](https://twitter.com/sehurlburt))

It sounds simple, but this was very freeing. I had felt this need to get back to everyone in a timely manner. After I spoke to Stephanie, I felt like I had permission to take my time. I resumed the projects I was working on but would add an item to my daily to-do list: "Respond to five emails," or "Respond to 20 twitter DMs."

**Sidenote**: Stephanie *says*  it's okay to delay responses for a month, but she wrote me a very thoughtful three-paragraph reply a few minutes after I asked her my question. It's possible that she's tricking me with this advice so that she can maintain her position as the most helpful person on Twitter.

Stephanie also recommended that I accept the fact that I can't respond to every message, so I need to define what criteria that determines . What I was doing was unsystematically looking at all my unanswered messages and deciding which to answer next. But that meant repeatedly looking at the same messages even if it was .

Will this lead to a conversation I'm interested in having?
Is the person offering me something that I value?

## Managing stress

Before I quit, I kept hearing stories about how founding even a small business comes with a lot of stress. I thought, "I'm sure that's true but I'm going to be spending every day in my pajamas. How stressed will I really be?"

{% include image.html file="so-stressed.png" alt="The stresses of my daily life after quitting my job" max_width="750px" img_link=true %}

But they were right. I did feel stress. Not about things that I thought people stressed about like money or customers. I was just stressing about deadlines I set for myself that nobody else cared about or even knew existed. I felt more anxious about my self-imposed deadlines than I ever did about deadlines at my actual job.

Before I quit, I had this vision of self-employment where I'd have unlimited time. The eight hours a day I was spending in the office felt like an eternity. If I could cut those out, I'd have eternal *free* time.

So I committed to more projects than I should have, started collaborations with more people than I could practically collaborate with. It took me a few weeks to realize what I'd done and then another six weeks to gracefully complete my obligations, all the while saying "no" to everyone who approached me with new stuff.

Since then, I've felt less stressed about deadlines, but I'm experiencing a different kind of stress, which I'll call "enthusiasm stress." I get so excited about whatever I'm working on that I just shut out everything else. I stop planning to see friends, and I can't fall asleep because my thoughts are too consumed with what code I want to write tomorrow.

I think I'm coming around to a solution for this as well. Meditation and to-do lists.

## Failed project: Space Duck

For the past two years, I've contributed to and [written frequently](/tags/#sia) about a decentralized storage project called Sia.

It was an obvious choice for my post-Google focus. One of its main value propositions is that it allows users to store and transfer data at much cheaper rates than providers like Amazon or Google.

Sia is still pretty obscure. Not many people understand how to use it, so nobody had built any real services on top of it yet. But I understood it. Maybe I could find a business whose main cost is storage or data transfer and just build the Sia-powered version of that. TODO: find an example of a company who spends a ton on bandwidth.

I also liked writing about Sia. I thought that could either continue blogging about Sia and use it to attract customers to whatever service I was building. Or maybe writing about Sia and decentralized storage technology would be lucrative in itself.

{% include image.html file="space-duck-logo.png" alt="Space Duck logo" max_width="750px" link_url="https://blog.spaceduck.io" %}

I began with an exploratory project to measure Sia's capacity and costs. Sia claimed that it was 1/10th the cost of Amazon, but nobody had ever measured this in practice. With Amazon, you get a bill at the end of the month, and that's your cost. Because Sia is decentralized, there's no single company to send you a bill. Instead, the software automatically makes dozens of tiny contracts with anonymous hosts. It's difficult to untangle all the data to figure out what you actually paid. Nobody ever had the combination of time, motivation, and knowledge to do it. But as a Sia enthusiast who just quit his job, I realized that person was me.

Unfortunately, the results of the test were disappointing. I concluded that Sia was [not as cheap as everyone thought](https://blog.spaceduck.io/load-test-wrapup/#storage-isnt-that-cheap). Worse, I encountered [so many bugs](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+author%3Amtlynch+) during basic usage that received so little attention from the core developers that I realized this wasn't the horse I should hitch my wagon to.

The blogging part wasn't working out either. I probably had ~100% market share of people interested in technical blog posts about Sia. Unforutnately, that population is about 40 people.

## Reading ingredients

I've been reading a lot of ingredients.

That's not a metaphor. I've spent the last few weeks staring at thousands of ingredients from recipes. "2 1/2 lbs ground beef", "2 diced lettuce heads."

Ingredients generally break down into four pieces of information:

TODO: Graphic of \[quantity\] \[units\] \[thing you buy at the store\] \[what you do to prepare it\]

Humans can interpret ingredients easily. When you see, "2 tomatoes, diced," you know to go to the store, buy two tomatoes, then dice them. If you see, "2 tablespoons ground cinnamon," you're probably not going to buy cinnamon sticks and a cinnamon grinder. You'll buy a thing of ground cinnamon. (TODO: pick an example that I do well)

It's much harder for computers to figure this out. This was a problem I had with KetoHub, my keto recipe aggregator site. When users enter ingredients into KetoHub, what they probably mean to search for is the thing they bought from the grocery store. If you search KetoHub for "Dash" you probably want to see recipes that use [Mrs. Dash seasoning](https://amzn.to/2Ks05bh) and not every recipe ever that happpens to include "a **dash** of cinnamon.".

For the initial version of KetoHub, I just did this with regular expressions, a quick and dirty way of processing text programmatically.

TODO: Quote about regular expressions.

Over time, my regular expressions got more complicated and fragile, so I needed a more robust solution.

[heinous bundle of regexes](http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247)

A few months ago, a commenter on Indie Hackers [showed me](https://www.indiehackers.com/forum/ketohub-month-2-report-1229ddb803?commentId=-L-clmWeoqUnFcAzTi5t) a blog post about how *The New York Times* [parsed ingredients](https://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/extracting-structured-data-from-recipes-using-conditional-random-fields/)  from their back catalogue of recipes using machine learning. That sounded neat, but it would be overkill for my little recipe aggregator site.

## Ingredient parsing as a service

Then I remembered a blog post I liked by Jason Fried called, ["Sell Your By-products."](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1620-sell-your-by-products). If this was a problem for KetoHub, maybe it was a problem for other sites and I could sell my API to them. There are APIs that do this already, but they're either pathetically inaccurate or have very oppressive licensing terms.

If you've got an app that needs to understand ingredients or you know someone who does, send me an email at michael@mtlynch.io.
