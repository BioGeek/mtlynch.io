I started working at Google in 2014. For two years, I loved the job

# The honeymoon period

If you had asked me 18 months ago how long I planned to work for Google, I'd have said I'd be there at least another five years. Two years is the longest I've loved any job. There was a lot to love.

I'll skip the usual stuff like free food and massages.

# The promo process

Before I go any further, I have to explain the Google promotion process. Promotions are decided by committees. There's a lot of complexity to how these committees operate, but for the sake of brevity, I'll say that these committees award promotions to software engineers based on:

* Evidence that you can manage complexity
* Evidence that your work has had a positive impact on Google

# That's great, except...

On its face, these criteria sound very sensible.

# Work that won't get you promoted

## Fixing a bug

You can get promoted by *closing* bugs. Find some component that's old and has hundreds of bugs assigned to it, then totally rewrite a new, shiny version with *zero* known bugs. Then you can show it to the promotion committee and say, "Look! I closed *hundreds* of bugs!" This is not exclusive to Google. Famed Netscape developer jwz refers to this as the ["Cascade of Attention-Deficit Teenagers" model](https://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html) of bug hygiene.

## Maintenance work

Given Google's incentives for from-scratch rewrites, it probably isn't surprising that Google does a lot of from scratch rewrites. So every few months, your team will receive an email like this one:

>We're emailing you because you're a client of CruftySystem.
>
>Good news! We're shutting down CruftySystem so that all of its clients can move to ShinySystem. You'll be much happier on ShinySystem because it does 80% of what CruftySystem does, but better!
>
>If you depended on that last 20% of features, don't worry! Some of that functionality is available in DeprecatedSystem and some is available in UndocumentedSystem. There's an open bug right now that prevents you from using those two systems at the same time, but we're confident that someone will choose to assign it to themselves any day now.

You spent 6 weeks on this, but it means nothing to the promotion committee. The work doesn't seem hard because hundreds of teams did the same migration. There's no measurable impact because all you did was keep things running the same as they were before. To the promotion committee, this work has the same value as if you took a six week vacation and left one of your teammates to do the same work.

## Service to your team

# The holiday gift wake up call

Google made headlines in 2016 for their holiday gifts. They had a long-running tradition of giving their employees lavish holiday gifts, such as premium Android phones or $1000 cash. In 2016, they announced that instead of giving us gifts, they were instead giving the equivalent value in Chromebooks to underprivileged schoolchildren.

This created controversy within Google. Some were upset to lose their gift, others were upset that people felt entitled to a gift. Some felt that gift or not, it represented a cut of ~$500-1000 in annual benefits.

At this time, I witnessed a conversation between two employees that was eye-opening for me:

>**Employee A**: You effectively are still getting the gift. You still receive compensation in stock awards. Cuts like this increase the value of Google's stock. You can sell your shares and buy any present you choose.
>
>**Employee B**: If I told my wift that I wasn't buying her a Christmas gift, but it was okay because the money was available in our bank account to buy whatever present she wanted, that wouldn't go over well.
>
>**Employee A**: You're in a *business relationship* with Google. If you're disappointed that Google isn't "romancing" you enough as an employee, you have a misguided notion of the relationship.

Google does a lot to build a sense of community in employees. To make us feel that we're not just employees, but that we *are* Google.

This conversation made me realize that I'm *not* Google. I provide Google a service for which I am paid money.

I know it sounds really obvious, but it was a huge realization for me. There were all these things I did because I thought, "This isn't good for me, but it's the right thing for Google."

# Prospects

My coworkers keep asking me if I'm scared, but I'm not really sure why. Let me just think of a few people at random who I know left Google for other jobs:

Marissa Mayer

On average, these people now earn 120M per year. That's almost double what I make now!
