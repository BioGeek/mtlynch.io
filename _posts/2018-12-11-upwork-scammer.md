For years, I've hired freelancers through a marketplace called Upwork. I used the site to find cartoonists, software developers, editors, and virtual assistants. Some were great, some were disastrous, but I'd never had someone who was outright trying to scam me.

That is, until I met Lizzie.

I needed writers for [a nutrition website](https://isitketo.org) I'm working on. Lizzie seemed like a potential match. She was a young American writer &mdash; a native English speaker. Her [bio](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~019b8bbe4e49ebe61c/) was free of loud grammar errors, an alarmingly rare quality among freelance writers. And best of all, she only charged $10/hr. For comparison, a mid-range writer on Upwork typically charges $30-60/hr.

Okay, I know what you're thinking: for $10/hr, she's *obviously* a scammer. Or, at the very least, a terrible writer.

But that's part of the adventure of Upwork. Some of the best people I've worked with charged a suspiciously low rate because they wanted to build a good rating history. Lizzie had only worked a few jobs, but she had perfect reviews on all of them.

If she turned out to be talented, I'd have a great writer at a phenomenal price. If she was terrible, I'd at least get to see what $10/hr writing looked like.

# Exchanging $50 for a blank document

I offered Lizzie the job, and she accepted overnight. I assigned her three reports to write and gave her [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uy19xtf_PFW0LJ2Zj6cSkH2dhHED8PCjHCtup1_IQ_4/edit?usp=sharing) on how to write them. I linked her to a Google Doc where she could write the reports.

I set a limit of 5 hours per week and told her that if she wasn't done with the three reports at the 4.5 hour mark, she should spend the last 30 minutes putting all of her progress in our shared Google Doc.

The next day, I saw that Lizzie billed me the full five hours but hadn't sent me any messages. The Google Doc I gave her was empty.

# Intrusive surveillance to the rescue

When I checked Lizzie's timesheet, I realized that Lizzie had logged her hours using Work Diary, Upwork's official spyware tool. It records the freelancer's screen, records their keystrokes, and sends all the information to both Upwork and the client.

I find this tool extremely creepy, so I never require freelancers to use it, but Lizzie had elected to use it. This meant that I didn't have the work I paid for, but I did have screenshots showing what Lizzie was doing in the five hours she was supposedly working for me.

I checked one of the screenshots from when she began billing to me:

{% include image.html file="workdiary-2.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Lizzie R's WorkDiary history" max_width="800px" img_link="true" fig_caption="First Work Diary screenshot" %}

It was a document about mantras in Hinduism. It definitely had nothing to do with my project, but she was billing the work to me.

Later, she switched gears and started writing an article about tarot cards:

{% include image.html file="workdiary-4.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Lizzie R's WorkDiary history" max_width="800px" img_link="true" fig_caption="First Work Diary screenshot" %}

Unless there's a new trend in the keto diet that requires reading tarot cards, this didn't seem like it was related to my project either.

# What's going on here?

The plot thickened when one screenshot showed Lizzie using Upwork's messaging interface to talk to her other clients:

{% include image.html file="workdiary-5.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Lizzie R's WorkDiary history" max_width="800px" img_link="true" fig_caption="First Work Diary screenshot" %}

It  confused me at first because it showed two people talking but neither of them was Lizzie. Then, I realized she was logged in as a separate Upwork user with the name Abi Hensley.

I searched the name on Upwork and found [Abi's profile](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~012951f3927669080e). Sure enough, it had the exact same profile text and hourly rate as Lizzie:

{% include image.html file="abi-h-profile.png" alt="Screenshot of Abi H's Upwork profile" max_width="715px" img_link="true" fig_caption="Upwork profile for &quot;Abi H.&quot;, with identical text to &quot;Lizzie R.&quot;" %}

That explained why she had four different web browsers pinned to her taskbar. She probably used a separate browser for each of her Upwork identities.

# Who is Grace?

One of the screenshots shows Lizzie's Documents folder:

{% include image.html file="workdiary-6.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Lizzie R's WorkDiary history" max_width="800px" img_link="true" fig_caption="First Work Diary screenshot" %}

It shows several files with the name "Grace" in the title: "Grace Application Letter", "Grace CV", "Grace Intenship[sic] letter." There was a PDF whose filename was Grace followed by what looked like a last name. It was a unique enough last name that when I Googled the full name, there was only a single result: a Facebook profile:

{% include image.html file="grace-facebook.png" alt="Screenshot of Lizzie R's WorkDiary history" max_width="504px" img_link="true" fig_caption="Lizzie's true identity, potentially" %}

That's not very conclusive. She freelances, so maybe those are someone else's files. Or it's a profile for someone else who happens to have the same name.

# It's 9 PM. Do you know where you are?

I realized there was another hint in the screenshots. Upwork showed this screenshot at 6:15 PM Greenwich Mean Time but the freelancer's screen showed that it was 9:17 PM.

{% include image.html file="time-comparison.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Abi H's Upwork profile" max_width="715px" img_link="true" fig_caption="Upwork profile for &quot;Abi H.&quot;, with identical text to &quot;Lizzie R.&quot;" %}

What time zone could that be? Perhaps, Kenya. Sure enough...

{% include image.html file="utc-to-nairobi.png" alt="6:15 PM UTC matching 9:15 PM in Nairobi, Kenya" max_width="758px" img_link="true" %}

Not to sound like a [birther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories), but between the Kenyan name and the Kenyan time zone, my guess was that this freelancer lived in Kenya.

# What about that profile?

How did she write her profile so well? I Googled the text and realized she stitched together the content from two different Australian writers. One was [a profile on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laraflanagan/). She stole the other one from [another freelancer](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~017434da88fc78860a/) right from Upwork.

# Is this a trick?

The fraud seemed so bumbling and obvious that I feared I was falling for a deeper trick. In movies with con-men, there's always a part where they let the victim *think* that they've uncovered the fraud. But in so doing, the victim lets their guard down and leaves themselves vulnerable to the *actual* con. Was Lizzie trying to get caught so that she could trick me at another level? Why upload screenshots proving she didn't do the work when she could have just claimed the hours? Why bill and then give me nothing, giving me a reason to examine the screenshots?

# How did Upwork miss this?

Upwork forces freelancers to install invasive spyware, yet it fails to pick up on many signals that should have been be huge red flags:

* Two users are using the same computer and IP but claim to be in cities 2,000 miles apart.
* Two users have exactly identical profiles.
* Large sections of a new user's profile are plagiarized from a more established user on the same platform.
* Both users claim to live in the US but have their clocks set to Nairobi time and likely have Kenyan IP addresses.

# Reporting the fraud to Upwork

I closed the contract and reported the fraud to Upwork. 

# Results, finally

Lizzie can't see the feedback immediately. All she knew was that I closed the contract. A day after I closed it, Lizzie messaged me asking what the issue was. She attached the work I had asked for as a Word document. Here's her report on whether Coca-Cola is compatible with the keto diet:

>**Coca-Cola**
>
>***Short Description***
>
>Coca Cola is not keto because it contains high sugar content and not fats.
>
>***Detailed Description***
>
>According to the nutritional value of Coca Cola, it is not keto-friendly. It has 10.6 g of net carbs
for every serving. In addition, it has no fat and protein content. Perhaps, you can consider other
variations of Coca Cola like Coke Zero or the Diet Coke.

The grammar is decent, but there are some dead giveaways that Lizzie was not a native English speaker. Americans never say, "I'd love a refreshing can of **the** Diet Coke."

# How Upwork handles fraud

Two days later, Upwork customer support responded:

>Based on your report, I have examined the account and taken action as defined in our Terms of Service. In order to protect the confidentiality of all of our members’ accounts, I won’t be able to report back with the outcome of our investigation.

I disputed the hours, so Upwork refunded me the $50 that she tried to bill me.

It has been two weeks since I reported the fraud. The profiles went private a few days after I reported the issue, but Upwork still shows both profiles as active and accepting job offers:

* [Lizzie Ruprecht](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~019b8bbe4e49ebe61c/)
* [Abi Hensley](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~012951f3927669080e)

In my post-job feedback, I called out the profile as fraudulent. I kept it objective and factual, but I said that Work Diary revealed billing for unrelated work and multiple Upwork profiles. Curiously, Upwork displays my review as "No feedback given":

{% include image.html file="lizzie-feedback.jpg" alt="Upwork shows I left no feedback for Lizzie" max_width="697px" img_link="true" fig_caption="Upwork does not display my comments about Lizzie's fraudulent account in her Upwork profile." %}

I contacted one of Lizzie's other clients. He had hired "Abi" to write sales copy on his company's website. He told me that he appreciated me warning him about the fraud &mdash; Upwork never did.

# Upwork's cross-contamination problem

If you raised an eyebrow about me contacting another of Lizzie's clients, that's because I shouldn't be able to do it. A freelancer's client list is private on Upwork, but Lizzie bled enough information into her Work Diary screenshots that I could find one of her other clients.

This leads to another interesting problem with Upwork's Work Diary feature: cross-contamination.

What if a freelancer applied to work for you and ended their cover letter included this note:

>By the way, I routinely run software that sends captures of my entire screen to undisclosed third-parties. Hope that doesn't bother you!

You'd probably reject this candidate immediately. But that's what every Upwork user says implicitly if they use Work Diary to track their time.

As the client, there's nothing you can do to prevent this. You can allow the freelancer to enter their hours manually, but this risk still exists if .

# A cross-contamination thought experiment

Imagine this scenario: you email your freelancer a username and password to access your site. They check their e-mail, but whoops! They happened to check their email while they were working hourly for another client. Work Diary snapped a picture of the email you sent, credentials and all. You meant to send the information to just your freelancer, but now this other client has it as well.

You know who else has access to the screenshot? Upwork, of course. Any Upwork employee with access to Work Diary screenshots has these private credentials.

Oh, and Upwork's [privacy policy](https://www.upwork.com/legal#informationsharing) allows them to share your information with third parties. Maybe some of those vendors have access to your credentials now.

{% include image.html file="upwork-privacy-policy.png" alt="Screenshot of Upwork's privacy policy" max_width="792px" img_link="true" fig_caption=fig_caption %}

Oh, and by the way, Upwork stores Work Diary screenshots unencrypted on Amazon S3, so add Amazon to the list of extra people who have access to your data now.

Wow, that was fast! Your private credentials proliferated across several different organizations in seconds, but you have no way of detecting that it happened.

If you're sad about how little control you have over your data, think of how happy you're making all of the fastidious micromanagers who want to ensure that their freelancers are constantly at their keyboards, constantly producing tangible work. If Upwork didn't give them such invasive tools, how would they manage their workers?

# Final thoughts

I'll continue to use Upwork. I think it's the worst freelancing platform, except for all the other freelancing platforms. I'll certainly think twice before sending sensitive information to anyone who takes hourly contracts on Upwork.
