For years, I've hired software developers, graphic designers, and virtual assistants through a freelancing marketplace called Upwork. Some of my hires turned out to be excellent people that I've worked with for years. Some are completely unqualified for the job they apply for and I drop them instantly. Until a few weeks ago, nobody had attempted to scam me through Upwork, but when I did, I realized how poorly Upwork protects against it.

# The suspiciously cheap writer

I needed writers for a nutrition site I'm working on called [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org). Most of the freelance content writers on Upwork who claim English fluency charge in the $30-50. The high-end writers charge in the $80-150 range. That's why I was so surprised to find, [Lizzie](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~019b8bbe4e49ebe61c/), a young American woman charging only $10/hr. She had only a small reputation history on Upwork, but she had 100% perfect reviews. Unlike other low-cost writers, her profile was clear, concise, and free of loud grammatical errors.

I know what you're thinking: too good to be true. But I've had several experiences hiring freelancers for surprisingly low rates because they want to build their reputation.

I decided to hire Lizzie for 5 hours of work. If she's terrible, I lose $50. If she's good, I find a great freelancer for a low price.

# Exchanging $50 for a blank document

I offered Lizzie the job and she was excited to begin. I assigned her three reports for Is It Keto, linked her to the instructions, and linked her to a shared Google Doc for her to write the results.

I confirmed the five hour limit with Lizzie and said that if she wasn't done at the 4.5 hour mark, spend the last 30 minutes collecting what she had so far to share with me.

The next day, I saw that Lizzie billed the full five hours, but I hadn't received any messages from her. That was strange. I opened the shared document where she was supposed to write her results and found it untouched.

# Intrusive surveillance to the rescue

When I checked the hours, I realized that Lizzie had logged her time using Upwork's Work Diary. Work Diary is creepy spyware that some clients force their freelancers to install, which records the freelancer's screen and tracks their time. I never require it because I find it creepy, but Lizzie had chosen to use it. So I now had a bunch of monitoring for what Lizzie was doing in the five hours she was supposedly working for me.

It even collects information about how many keystrokes and mouse clicks the freelancer executed:

I could see from the thumbnails that she was editing a Word document, so I opened one up:

{% include image.html file="workdiary-2.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Lizzie R's WorkDiary history" max_width="800px" img_link="true" fig_caption="First Work Diary screenshot" %}

Okay, that's a document about mantras in Hinduism. Definitely nothing to do with my project, but she was billing the work to me.

As creepy as Work Diary is, it's up front with the freelancer that it's recording their screen. There's even a screen capture of Lizzie viewing the time tracker as it shows her the last screen capture:

{% include image.html file="workdiary-3.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Lizzie R's WorkDiary history" max_width="800px" img_link="true" fig_caption="First Work Diary screenshot" %}

{% include image.html file="workdiary-4.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Lizzie R's WorkDiary history" max_width="800px" img_link="true" fig_caption="First Work Diary screenshot" %}

It got really interesting when I saw a screenshot of Lizzie using Upwork's messaging interface to talk to her other clients:

{% include image.html file="workdiary-5.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Lizzie R's WorkDiary history" max_width="800px" img_link="true" fig_caption="First Work Diary screenshot" %}

This one confused me a bit because it was a conversation with Upwork, but neither end of the conversation was Lizzie. Then, I realized she was logged in as a separate Upwork user with the name Abi Hensley.

I searched the name on Upwork and found [Abi's profile](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~012951f3927669080e). Sure enough, it had the exact same profile text and hourly rate as Lizzie:

{% include image.html file="abi-h-profile.png" alt="Screenshot of Abi H's Upwork profile" max_width="715px" img_link="true" fig_caption="Upwork profile for &quot;Abi H.&quot;, with identical text to &quot;Lizzie R.&quot;" %}

# Who is Grace?

One of the screenshots shows Lizzie's Documents folder:

{% include image.html file="workdiary-6.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Lizzie R's WorkDiary history" max_width="800px" img_link="true" fig_caption="First Work Diary screenshot" %}

It shows several files with the name "Grace" in the title: "Grace Application Letter", "Grace CV", "Grace Intenship[sic] letter." There was a PDF whose filename was Grace followed by what looked like a last name. It was a unique enough last name that when I Googled the full name, there was only a single result. A Facebook profile:

{% include image.html file="grace-facebook.png" alt="Screenshot of Lizzie R's WorkDiary history" max_width="504px" img_link="true" fig_caption="Lizzie's true identity, potentially" %}

That's not very conclusive. She freelances, so maybe those are someone else's files. Or it's a profile for someone else who happens to have the same name.

# It's 9 PM. Do you know where you are?

I realized there was another hint in the screenshots. Upwork showed this screenshot at 6:15 PM Greenwich Mean Time but the freelancer's screen showed that it was 9:17 PM.

{% include image.html file="time-comparison.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Abi H's Upwork profile" max_width="715px" img_link="true" fig_caption="Upwork profile for &quot;Abi H.&quot;, with identical text to &quot;Lizzie R.&quot;" %}

I didn't know what time zone that was offhand, but I was sure it wasn't Nevada. I checked a time zone converter to find out how 6:15 PM translates to the time in Kenya. Sure enough...

{% include image.html file="utc-to-nairobi.png" alt="Screenshot of Abi H's Upwork profile" max_width="758px" img_link="true" fig_caption="Upwork profile for &quot;Abi H.&quot;, with identical text to &quot;Lizzie R.&quot;" %}

# Why even do this?

The strangest part is that Lizzie/Grace uploaded. She even watched it upload screenshots of her work.

I actually don't like Work Diary. I don't require it for freelancers I hire on Upwork. She could have just entered her hours and I wouldn't have known the difference. I don't require Work Diary.

I would have recognized that she wasn't a native English speaker but I would have probably just paid the $50 because I couldn't prove it.

# How did she write a good profile?

How did she write her profile so well? I Googled the text and realized she stitched together the content from two different Australian writers. Most of the text comes from this [woman's LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laraflanagan/) and the intro comes from [another freelancer](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~017434da88fc78860a/) right from Upwork.

# How did Upwork miss this?

Upwork forces the freelancer to install such invasive spyware, yet it fails to pick up on many signals that should be

* Two users are using the same computer and IP but claim to be in cities 2,000 miles apart.
* Two users have exactly identical profiles.
* Large sections of a new user's profile are plagiarized from a more established user on the same platform.
* Both users claim to live in the US but have their clocks set to Nairobi time and likely have Kenyan IP addresses.

I'll reserve a bit of judgment because I used to work on a fraud-detection team at Google, so I'm familiar with outsiders saying, "Why can't you just look for X," when the true reason is that there are non-obvious cases where X is a false positive. That said, it *really* seems like there were tons of clues here that Upwork should have caught.

But the more likely solution is that Upwork cares more about empowering micromanagers to ding their freelancers for not typing enough keystrokes.

# Reporting the fraud to Upwork

I closed the contract and reported the fraud to Upwork. Two days later, I received this response:

>Based on your report, I have examined the account and taken action as defined in our Terms of Service. In order to protect the confidentiality of all of our members’ accounts, I won’t be able to report back with the outcome of our investigation.

It has been two weeks since I reported the fraud, and Upwork still shows both profiles as active. The "Abi H" profile switched to private a few days after I filed the report, but both profiles still accept job offers.

# Upwork's cross-contamination problem

If you raised an eyebrow when you read that I contacted one of the freelancer's other clients, that's because I shouldn't be able to contact a freelancer's other clients. Upwork doesn't show the names of other clients that a freelancer works with. But Lizzie bled enough information into her Work Diary screenshots that I found the contact information for someone else who hired her to write copy for his website.

Which leads to another problem with Work Diary: cross-contamination.

If a freelancer said, "By the way, I run software on my computer that sends screenshots of what I do to undisclosed third-parties, some of whom might be your competitors." And you can't even turn it off. The most you can do is allow the freelancer to disable the screenshots when billing you for work, but it doesn't stop the freelancer from billing other clients and exposing your documents to them.
