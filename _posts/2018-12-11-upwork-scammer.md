I recently hired writers for a business I'm working on. To find freelance writers, I used Upwork, a site I frequently use to hire freelancers.

Most of the bids I received were in the $30-40 range. One was for $10: [Lizzie R.](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~019b8bbe4e49ebe61c/).

I know what you're thinking. Too good to be true. But I've hired a lot on Upwork and sometimes I do find people who seem vastly underpriced. Sometimes I value different qualities than other clients, so I get people who seem undervalued. Sometimes a freelancer is just starting out and sets a low rate to build their reputation.

If I'm wrong, I lose $50. If I'm right, I find a great freelancer for a low price.

# Too good to be true

I told Lizzie to limit her time to five hours. If she wasn't done at the 4.5 hour mark, spend the last 30 minutes collecting what she had so far to share with me. She billed five hours. The shared document was untouched, and I hadn't received any messages from her.

# Intrusive surveillance to the rescue

Upwork offers a . Lizzie had let Work Diary monitor her computer for the five hours she was supposedly working for me. Here's what it looks like for my contract with Lizzie:

It even collects information about how many keystrokes and mouse clicks the freelancer executed:

Here's the first screenshot:

{% include image.html file="workdiary-1.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Lizzie R's WorkDiary history" max_width="800px" img_link="true" fig_caption="First Work Diary screenshot" %}

Okay, that seems fine. She's off to a good start! She's checking how much space is left on her hard drive. She doesn't want to run out of space halfway through writing my document and leave me empty-handed.

The next several screenshots show Lizzie writing an article about mantras in Hinduism. Definitely nothing to do with my project, but she was billing the work to me.

It's important to note that the freelancers are aware that Upwork records their screen. One of the screenshots shows Lizzie looking at the Upwork app displaying the latest screenshot it logged.

{% include image.html file="workdiary-4.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Lizzie R's WorkDiary history" max_width="800px" img_link="true" fig_caption="First Work Diary screenshot" %}

It got really interesting when I saw a screenshot of Lizzie using Upwork's messaging interface to talk to her other clients:

{% include image.html file="workdiary-5.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Lizzie R's WorkDiary history" max_width="800px" img_link="true" fig_caption="First Work Diary screenshot" %}

This one confused me a bit because it was a conversation with Upwork, but neither end of the conversation was Lizzie. Then, I realized she was logged in as a separate Upwork user with the name Abi Hensley.

I searched the name on Upwork and found [Abi's profile](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~012951f3927669080e). Sure enough, it had the exact same profile text and hourly rate as Lizzie:

{% include image.html file="abi-h-profile.png" alt="Screenshot of Abi H's Upwork profile" max_width="715px" img_link="true" fig_caption="Upwork profile for &quot;Abi H.&quot;, with identical text to &quot;Lizzie R.&quot;" %}

# Who is Grace?

One of the screenshots shows Lizzie's Documents folder:

{% include image.html file="workdiary-6.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Lizzie R's WorkDiary history" max_width="800px" img_link="true" fig_caption="First Work Diary screenshot" %}

It shows several files with the name "Grace" in the title: "Grace Application Letter", "Grace CV", "Grace Intenship[sic] letter." There was a PDF whose filename was Grace followed by what looked like a last name. It was a unique enough last name that when I Googled the full name, there was only a single result. A Facebook profile:

{% include image.html file="grace-facebook.png" alt="Screenshot of Lizzie R's WorkDiary history" max_width="504px" img_link="true" fig_caption="Lizzie's true identity, potentially" %}

That's not very conclusive. She freelances, so maybe those are someone else's files. Or it's a profile for someone else who happens to have the same name.

# It's 9 PM. Do you know where you are?

I realized there was another hint in the screenshots. Upwork showed this screenshot at 6:15 PM Greenwich Mean Time but the freelancer's screen showed that it was 9:17 PM.

{% include image.html file="time-comparison.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Abi H's Upwork profile" max_width="715px" img_link="true" fig_caption="Upwork profile for &quot;Abi H.&quot;, with identical text to &quot;Lizzie R.&quot;" %}

I didn't know what time zone that was offhand, but I was sure it wasn't Nevada. I checked a time zone converter to find out how 6:15 PM translates to the time in Kenya. Sure enough...

{% include image.html file="utc-to-nairobi.png" alt="Screenshot of Abi H's Upwork profile" max_width="758px" img_link="true" fig_caption="Upwork profile for &quot;Abi H.&quot;, with identical text to &quot;Lizzie R.&quot;" %}

# Why even do this?

The strangest part is that Lizzie/Grace uploaded. She even watched it upload screenshots of her work.

I actually don't like Work Diary. I don't require it for freelancers I hire on Upwork. She could have just entered her hours and I wouldn't have known the difference. I don't require Work Diary.

I would have recognized that she wasn't a native English speaker but I would have probably just paid the $50 because I couldn't prove it.

# How did she write a good profile?

How did she write her profile so well? I Googled the text and realized she stitched together the content from two different Australian writers. Most of the text comes from this [woman's LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laraflanagan/) and the intro comes from [another freelancer](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~017434da88fc78860a/) right from Upwork.

# How did Upwork miss this?

Upwork forces the freelancer to install such invasive spyware, yet it fails to pick up on many signals that should be

* Two users are using the same computer and IP but claim to be in cities 2,000 miles apart.
* Two users have exactly identical profiles.
* Large sections of a new user's profile are plagiarized from a more established user on the same platform.
* Both users claim to live in the US but have their time zones set to Nairobi and likely have Kenyan IP addresses.

I'll reserve a bit of judgment because I used to work on a fraud-detection team at Google, so I'm familiar with outsiders saying, "Why can't you just look for X," when the true reason is that there are non-obvious cases where X is a false positive. That said, it *really* seems like there were tons of clues here that Upwork should have caught.

But the more likely solution is that Upwork cares more about empowering micromanagers to ding their freelancers for not typing enough keystrokes.

# Reporting the fraud to Upwork

I closed the contract and reported the fraud to Upwork. Two days later, I received this response:

>Based on your report, I have examined the account and taken action as defined in our Terms of Service. In order to protect the confidentiality of all of our members’ accounts, I won’t be able to report back with the outcome of our investigation.

It has been two weeks since I reported the fraud, and Upwork still shows both profiles as active. The "Abi H" profile switched to private a few days after I filed the report, but both profiles still accept job offers.

# Upwork's cross-contamination problem

If you raised an eyebrow when you read that I contacted one of the freelancer's other clients, that's because I shouldn't be able to contact a freelancer's other clients. Upwork doesn't show the names of other clients that a freelancer works with. But Lizzie bled enough information into her Work Diary screenshots that I found the contact information for someone else who hired her to write copy for his website.

Which leads to another problem with Work Diary: cross-contamination.

If a freelancer said, "By the way, I run software on my computer that sends screenshots of what I do to undisclosed third-parties, some of whom might be your competitors." And you can't even turn it off. The most you can do is allow the freelancer to disable the screenshots when billing you for work, but it doesn't stop the freelancer from billing other clients and exposing your documents to them.
