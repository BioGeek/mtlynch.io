For years, I've hired freelancers through a marketplace called Upwork. I used the site to find cartoonists, software developers, editors, and virtual assistants. Some were great, some were disastrous, but I'd never had someone who was outright trying to scam me.

That is, until I met Lizzie.

I needed writers for [a nutrition website](https://isitketo.org) I'm working on. Lizzie seemed like a potential match. She was a young American writer &mdash; a native English speaker. Her [bio](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~019b8bbe4e49ebe61c/) was free of loud grammar errors, an alarmingly rare quality among freelance writers. And best of all, she only charged $10/hr. For comparison, a mid-range writer on Upwork typically charges $30-60/hr.

Okay, I know what you're thinking: for $10/hr, she's *obviously* a scammer. Or, at the very least, a terrible writer.

But that's part of the adventure of Upwork. Some of the best people I've worked with charged a suspiciously low rate because they wanted to build a good rating history. Lizzie had only worked a few jobs, but she had perfect reviews on all of them.

If she turned out to be talented, I'd have a great writer at a phenomenal price. If she was terrible, I'd at least get to see what $10/hr writing looked like.

# Hiring

The only way Lizzie could really burn me would be if I just let her go nuts: unlimited hours and send me the bill later. She could churn out garbage and claim she worked on it for 50 hours and 

Lizzie's cheap rate set off some alarm bells for me, but there was little risk in offering her the job. I could just limit her to five hours per week and see how she did with that time. If she turned out to be terrible, I'm only out 50 bucks.

If nothing else, I was curious to see what $10/hr writing looked like.

I offered Lizzie the job, and the next morning, I saw that she accepted. I assigned her three reports to write and gave her [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uy19xtf_PFW0LJ2Zj6cSkH2dhHED8PCjHCtup1_IQ_4/edit?usp=sharing) on how to write them. I linked her to a Google Doc where she could write the reports.

Not wanting to take any chances on the five hour cap, I told her that if she wasn't done with the three reports at the 4.5 hour mark, she should spend the last 30 minutes putting all of her progress in our shared Google Doc.

# Exchanging $50 for a blank document

The next day, I saw that Lizzie billed the full five hours but hadn't sent me any messages. The Google Doc I gave her was empty.

# Intrusive surveillance to the rescue

When I checked the hours, I realized that Lizzie had logged her time using Work Diary, Upwork's official spyware tool. It records the freelancer's screen, tracks their time, and sends all the information to both Upwork and the client.

I find this tool extremely creepy, so I never require freelancers to use it, but Lizzie had elected to use it. This meant that I didn't have the work I paid for, but I did have screenshots showing what Lizzie was doing in the five hours she was supposedly working for me.

I checked one of the screenshots from when she began billing to me:

{% include image.html file="workdiary-2.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Lizzie R's WorkDiary history" max_width="800px" img_link="true" fig_caption="First Work Diary screenshot" %}

It was a document about mantras in Hinduism. It definitely had nothing to do with my project, but she was billing the work to me.

Later, she switched gears and started writing an article about tarot cards:

# Wait, these are clues!

It got really interesting when I saw a screenshot of Lizzie using Upwork's messaging interface to talk to her other clients:

{% include image.html file="workdiary-5.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Lizzie R's WorkDiary history" max_width="800px" img_link="true" fig_caption="First Work Diary screenshot" %}

This one confused me a bit because it was a conversation with Upwork, but neither end of the conversation was Lizzie. Then, I realized she was logged in as a separate Upwork user with the name Abi Hensley.

I searched the name on Upwork and found [Abi's profile](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~012951f3927669080e). Sure enough, it had the exact same profile text and hourly rate as Lizzie:

{% include image.html file="abi-h-profile.png" alt="Screenshot of Abi H's Upwork profile" max_width="715px" img_link="true" fig_caption="Upwork profile for &quot;Abi H.&quot;, with identical text to &quot;Lizzie R.&quot;" %}

That explained why she had four different web browsers pinned to her taskbar. She probably used a separate browser for each of her Upwork identities.

# Who is Grace?

One of the screenshots shows Lizzie's Documents folder:

{% include image.html file="workdiary-6.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Lizzie R's WorkDiary history" max_width="800px" img_link="true" fig_caption="First Work Diary screenshot" %}

It shows several files with the name "Grace" in the title: "Grace Application Letter", "Grace CV", "Grace Intenship[sic] letter." There was a PDF whose filename was Grace followed by what looked like a last name. It was a unique enough last name that when I Googled the full name, there was only a single result: a Facebook profile:

{% include image.html file="grace-facebook.png" alt="Screenshot of Lizzie R's WorkDiary history" max_width="504px" img_link="true" fig_caption="Lizzie's true identity, potentially" %}

That's not very conclusive. She freelances, so maybe those are someone else's files. Or it's a profile for someone else who happens to have the same name.

# It's 9 PM. Do you know where you are?

I realized there was another hint in the screenshots. Upwork showed this screenshot at 6:15 PM Greenwich Mean Time but the freelancer's screen showed that it was 9:17 PM.

{% include image.html file="time-comparison.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Abi H's Upwork profile" max_width="715px" img_link="true" fig_caption="Upwork profile for &quot;Abi H.&quot;, with identical text to &quot;Lizzie R.&quot;" %}

What time zone could that be? Perhaps, Kenya. Sure enough...

# How did she write a good profile?

How did she write her profile so well? I Googled the text and realized she stitched together the content from two different Australian writers. One was [a profile on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laraflanagan/). She stole the other one from [another freelancer](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~017434da88fc78860a/) right from Upwork.

# Is this a trick?

The fraud seemed so bumbling and obvious that I feared I was falling for a deeper trick. In movies with con-men, there's always a part where they let the victim *think* that they've uncovered the fraud. But in so doing, the victim lets their guard down and leaves themselves vulnerable to the *actual* con. Was Lizzie trying to get caught so that she could trick me at another level?

# How did Upwork miss this?

Upwork forces freelancers to install invasive spyware, yet it fails to pick up on many signals that should have been be huge red flags:

* Two users are using the same computer and IP but claim to be in cities 2,000 miles apart.
* Two users have exactly identical profiles.
* Large sections of a new user's profile are plagiarized from a more established user on the same platform.
* Both users claim to live in the US but have their clocks set to Nairobi time and likely have Kenyan IP addresses.

# Reporting the fraud to Upwork

I closed the contract and reported the fraud to Upwork. Two days later, Upwork customer support responded:

>Based on your report, I have examined the account and taken action as defined in our Terms of Service. In order to protect the confidentiality of all of our members’ accounts, I won’t be able to report back with the outcome of our investigation.

It has been two weeks since I reported the fraud, and Upwork still shows both profiles as active. The "Abi H" profile switched to private a few days after I filed the report, but both profiles still accept job offers.

I disputed the hours, so Upwork refunded me the $50 that she tried to bill me.

I warned other clients about Lizzie in the post-job feedback. I kept it objective and factual. I said that Work Diary revealed that Lizzie billed me for unrelated work and that she was operating multiple Upwork profiles. Curiously, Upwork shows my feedback as "No feedback given":

TODO: Screenshot of "No feedback given"

# Warning Lizzie's other clients

Talk about reporting to other clients.

# Results, finally

Lizzie can't see the feedback immediately. All she knew was that I closed the contract. A day after I closed it, Lizzie messaged me asking what the issue was. She attached the work I had asked for as a Word document. It was actually better than I expected:

>**Coca-Cola**
>
>***Short Description***
>
>Coca Cola is not keto because it contains high sugar content and not fats.
>
>***Detailed Description***
>
>According to the nutritional value of Coca Cola, it is not keto-friendly. It has 10.6 g of net carbs
for every serving. In addition, it has no fat and protein content. Perhaps, you can consider other
variations of Coca Cola like Coke Zero or the Diet Coke.

The grammar is decent, but there are some dead giveaways that Lizzie was not a native English speaker. Americans never say, "I'd love a refreshing can of **the** Diet Coke."

# Upwork's cross-contamination problem

If you raised an eyebrow when you read that I contacted one of the freelancer's other clients, that's because I shouldn't be able to contact a freelancer's other clients. Upwork doesn't show the names of other clients that a freelancer works with. But Lizzie bled enough information into her Work Diary screenshots that I found the contact information for someone else who hired her to write copy for his website.

Which leads to another problem with Work Diary: cross-contamination.

Imagine if a freelancer applied to work for you and ended their cover letter with this caveat:

>Oh, also! I routinely run software that sends captures of my entire screen to undisclosed third-parties. Hope that doesn't bother you!

You'd probably reject this candidate immediately. But that's implicitly what every Upwork is saying if they take hourly jobs on Upwork.

As the client, there's nothing you can do to prevent this. You can allow the freelancer to bill you by entering their time manually, but the problem is not with the hours they bill to you, but to their other clients.

Picture this scenario: while working for another client, your freelancer sees that they received a new email. Like most modern information workers, they can't resist an unread email burning a hole in their inbox, so they decide to quickly check it and get back to their billable work. It's an email from you containing a username and password you gave them to access your site. Whoops! Work Diary took a snapshot of it, so now their other client has the credentials, too.

Oh, you know who else has access to it? Upwork, of course. Any Upwork employee with access to Work Diary screenshots now gets your credentials.

Oh, and Upwork's [privacy policy](https://www.upwork.com/legal#informationsharing) says that they can share your private information with third parties. Maybe some of those vendors have access to your credentials now.


{% include image.html file="upwork-privacy-policy.png" alt="Screenshot of Upwork's privacy policy" max_width="800px" class="img-border" img_link="true" %}

Oh, and by the way, Upwork stores Work Diary screenshots unencrypted on Amazon S3, so add Amazon to the list of extra people who maybe have access to your data.

Wow, that was fast! Your private credentials proliferated across several different organizations in seconds, but you have no way of detecting that it happened.

# Final thoughts

I'll continue to use Upwork. I think it's the worst freelancing platform, except for all the other freelancing platforms. I'll certainly think twice before sending sensitive information to anyone who takes hourly contracts on Upwork.
