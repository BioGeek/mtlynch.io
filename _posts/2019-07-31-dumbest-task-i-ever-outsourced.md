I once gave someone a cheap, dirty keyboard and $96 cash in exchange for $0 and an identical but slightly cleaner keyboard. Looking back, it wasn't my best trade.

## It all started with a writing class

Back in 2016, I lived in a small studio apartment in Manhattan. It was a Monday night, and I was sitting in front of my computer trying to write a short story. I hadn't written fiction since graduating high school a decade earlier, but I recently signed up for a writing class and my first story was due at 9 AM the next day.

Desperate for any distraction, I became fixated on my keyboard. It was so dusty and grimy. How had I not noticed this before? I had the same keyboard for five or six years, typing on it 20-30 hours per week, eating all my meals in front of it. Growing up, my parents routinely popped all the keys off of our keyboards to deep clean them in rubbing alcohol. Did people still do that?

I should do that!

No, I couldn't do that. I'd never finish my story.

I admitted to myself that I was simply procrastinating, but the only way I could stop was to make a deal with myself that I'd deal with it for real after submitting the story.

## Outsource it

At the time, I was making good money working for Google, but I felt constantly short on time. Outsourcing seemed like the solution. If there was a task that would bring me no pleasure to do myself, and it would take more than an hour, I'd try to hire someone to do it instead.

[TaskRabbit](https://www.taskrabbit.com) is one of the popular apps for the gig economy. It allows users to book one-off tasks like cleaning an apartment or mounting a TV. "Keyboard deep cleaning" didn't seem to be one of their pre-defined jobs, so I booked the job as "Small cleaning" and explained in the description that I wanted someone to clean my keyboard. TaskRabbit has a one-hour minimum, and I was afraid my keyboard task wouldn't take the full hour, so I also said I wanted the person to clean some dishes I had piled up in the sink.

## Must have at least 15 years of keyboard cleaning experience

Many of the people who responded to my TaskRabbit job were confused.

One applicant told me that she wanted to be up front in that she had "zero keyboard cleaning experience." I assured her that was okay. She only had to take out the keys, wipe them with rubbing alcohol, and put them back.

Another candidate was pregnant and needed to know whether the job required heavy lifting. I promised her that it was one of those fancy, modern keyboards that weighs less than 35 pounds.

Finally, I received an offer from Jaclyn S. She had supreme confidence in her ability to clean the keyboard and had no questions except for what supplies to bring. Within 20 minutes, we had booked the job for 3pm the following day.

## The first hiccup

The next day, Jaclyn S. messaged me around 1pm saying that her morning job exploded into a 10-hour task. She wouldn't be able to make our 3pm appointment and said we could either reschedule for 9pm or the following day.

I was annoyed, but only because the reschedule forced me to admit to myself and to Jaclyn S that I, a 31-year-old guy living in Manhattan, had nothing better to do on a Saturday night than watch someone clean my keyboard. I told her 9pm was fine and awaited her arrival.

## Timeline

Jaclyn S. arrived just after 8:30pm. Here's the play-by-play of how the evening went:

### 8:35pm, 5 minutes elapsed

I put the keyboard in the kitchen along with a few days' worth of dirty dishes. I gave her Q-Tips, paper towels, and a bottle of rubbing alcohol for the keyboard. I showed her how to pop the plastic keys out of the keyboard. I rolled a spare office chair into the kitchen so that she could sit comfortably in front of my cabinets as she worked.

Giving her privacy, I went back to work in my bedroom / living room. I heard her start on the dishes. So far so good.

### 9pm: 0.5 hours elapsed

I hear the sink turn off and the sounds of keys being popped off my keyboard. Great! Everything's on schedule.

### 9:30pm: 1 hour elapsed

Okay, she's been on the keyboard for half an hour. She'll probably be done any minute now.

### 10:00pm, 1.5 hours elapsed

*Any* minute now.

### 10:15pm: 1.75 hours elapsed

The sounds coming from the kitchen sound panicked, like someone who screwed up and didn't want to ask for help.  Was she having trouble putting the keys back in? Did she break something and was scrambling to fix it? Maybe I'm just projecting.

As someone who also doesn't like asking for help when I've screwed up, I sympathized with her plight and left her to figure it out on her own. I considered going in and asking how things were going, but I didn't want to micromanage her or rush her. I also felt extreme guilt at even having her there at all. She had already gotten suckered into working much longer than she expected, and I was now here she was approaching hour 13 of her workday because some idiot expected her to reconstruct his keyboard.

### 11pm: 2.5 hours elapsed

I walk by the kitchen on my way to the bathroom and try to subtly peek in to see what was going on. Most of the keys were still outside the keyboard, but Jaclyn S.'s back is to me blocking the keyboard, so I couldn't see much.

She had to finish eventually, so I just wait. I feel like I should ask her if she needs help, but I'm also feeling tremendously guilty about making this poor woman sit in my kitchen at 11pm on a Saturday night scrubbing a keyboard.

### 11:30pm: 3 hours elapsed

She's still working. The sounds of the work still sound anxious.

### 11:45pm, 3.25 hours elapsed

There's something victorious in the sounds of her work now. Surely, it's almost over.

### 12am: 3.5 hours elapsed

Jaclyn S. came out carrying my keyboard. It was spic 'n span and all put back together. I thank her for her work and plug my keyboard back in. Everything works fine.

## The bill

Final cost for Jaclyn's keyboard cleaning: $95.55.

Out of curiosity, I checked what I paid for that keyboard brand new: $38.89.

I spent $96 to clean a $39 keyboard.

## It's not *that* dumb

The reaction from many people when they hear this story is that they'd never waste so much money hiring a keyboard cleaner because they'd just clean it themselves. They're missing the point.

A helpful way of evaluating whether to outsource something is to ask yourself how much someone would have to pay *you* to do the task. At the time, I was rolling in money from my cushy Google job but desperate for free time. For me to sacrifice my limited personal time to clean someone's keyboard, they'd have to pay me well above $100/hr. So it would be illogical for me to clean my keyboard when others are willing to do it for far less.

That said, there's obviously something hinky going on when the cost of routine maintenance is many times the value of the item itself, so what went wrong here?

## Lessons learned

### Outsourcing doesn't scale down

Between the time I spent arranging the job and feeling distracted by the poor woman stuck in my kitchen for three hours, it cost me more time to outsource this task than to do it myself.

For any outsourced task, there's some frictional cost of defining the job and finding a candidate. For small, one-time tasks, the frictional costs can be a large enough proportion of the total job time that it's not worth outsourcing.

### Invest more in training

The keyboard needed a good cleaning, but not *three hours* of cleaning. Three hours is like if I dipped my keyboard into a vat of molasses.

It's possible that my cleaner was cleaning each key more thoroughly than was necessary. Perhaps she got stuck trying to put the keyboard back together and was afraid to ask for help. I could have prevented either by giving her more instructions up front and letting her know it's okay to watch YouTube videos or ask me for guidance.

### There's always craigslist

I knew up front that the cost of cleaning the keyboard might exceed its value, but the only alternative I considered was throwing away a perfectly good keyboard.

If I had to do this again, I'd buy a new keyboard and offer the old one for free to an online community like [craigslist](https://craigslist.org) or my local [buy nothing group](https://buynothingproject.org).

**Sidenote**: People have suggested donating it to The Salvation Army, but I don't think it makes sense for such a cheap item. For higher-value items, I happily donate. For low-value items, I suspect that sending it through The Salvation Army's whole receiving, processing, displaying, and selling process is a net negative.
