title: The Dumbest Task I Ever Outsourced

I once traded a dirty keyboard and $95 cash so that I could get $0 and an identical but slightly cleaner keyboard. Looking back, it wasn't my best trade.

## It all started with a writing class

Back in 2016, I lived in a small studio apartment in Manhattan. It was a Monday night, and I was sitting in front of my computer trying to write a short story. I hadn't written fiction since graduating high school a decade earlier, but I missed it, so I signed up for a class nearby in Brooklyn.

At least, I *thought* I missed writing. The story was due at 9 AM the next day. All of my story ideas felt terrible. I was cursing my decision to take this class and looking for any distraction from my assignment.

I became fixated on my keyboard. It was so dusty and grimy. How had I not noticed this before? I had the same keyboard for five or six years, typing on it 20-30 hours per week, eating all my meals in front of it. Growing up, my parents (both programmers) routinely popped all the keys off of our keyboards to deep clean them in rubbing alcohol. Did people still do that?

I should do that!

No, I couldn't do that. I'd never finish my story.

I admitted to myself that I was simply procrastinating, but the only way I was able to stop obsessing about my dirty keyboard was to make a deal with myself that I'd clean it for real once the story was done.

## Gig economy to the rescue

At the time, I was making good money working for Google, but I felt constantly short on time. Outsourcing seemed like the solution. If there was a task that would bring me no pleasure to do myself, and it would take more than an hour, I'd try to hire someone to do it instead.

[TaskRabbit](https://www.taskrabbit.com) is one of the popular apps for the gig economy. It allows users to book one-off tasks like cleaning an apartment or mounting a TV. "Keyboard deep cleaning" didn't seem to be one of their pre-defined jobs, so I booked the job as "Small cleaning" and explained in the description that I wanted someone to clean my keyboard. TaskRabbit has a one-hour minimum, and I was afraid my keyboard task wouldn't take the full hour, so I also said I wanted the person to clean some dishes I had piled up in the sink.

## A minimum of 15 years keyboard cleaning experience

Many of the people who responded to my TaskRabbit job were confused.

One applicant told me that they wanted to be up front in that they have no keyboard cleaning experience. I told them it was fine. All they really needed to do was take out the keys, swab them with rubbing alcohol, and put them back.

Another told me that they were pregnant and wanted to make sure cleaning the keyboard didn't require heavy lifting. I assured her that I had one of those fancy, modern keyboards that weighs less than 35 pounds.

Finally, Jaclyn S. contacted me with supreme confidence in her ability to clean the keyboard. Within 20 minutes, I hired her and booked her for the following day.

## Cleaning day

Jaclyn S. agreed to take my job. She was scheduled to arrive Saturday at 3pm. She messaged me around 1pm saying that her morning job exploded into a 10-hour task, so she wouldn't be able to make it by 3pm and wanted to know if we could reschedule for the following day. I asked if she had any availability later in the day and she . She said she could come at 9pm if that worked, or we'd have to rebook for another day. I already planned work to do on my laptop while she was there, so I didn't want to reschedule. I decided to just let her come at 9pm.

Jaclyn S. arrived a little after 9pm. At the time, I lived in a small studio apartment in Manhattan. If she cleaned the keyboard in my living room / bedroom, it would feel awkward just sitting three feet away from her and pretending to ignore her while I worked. I figured it would give us both privacy if she worked in the kitchen, which was separated from the bedroom by a wall.

I put the keyboard in the kitchen along with a few days' worth of dirty dishes. I gave her Q-Tips, paper towels, and a bottle of rubbing alcohol for the keyboard. I showed her how to pop the plastic keys out of the keyboard. I rolled a spare office chair into the kitchen so that she could sit comfortably in front of my cabinets as she worked.

Giving her privacy, I went back to work in my bedroom. I heard her start on the dishes. So far so good. A half hour later, I heard the sink turn off and began hearing the sounds of keys being popped off my keyboard. Great! Everything was going according to schedule.

At around 10pm, I began preparing to hear her come out and declare victory. By 10:15pm, I figured she'd be done any minute now. I continued feeling that way until 10:45pm.

## Is everything going okay?

I'm not sure if I'm just projecting, but the sounds coming from the kitchen sounded panicked, like someone who screwed up and didn't want to ask for help. Was she having trouble putting the keys back in? Did she break something and was scrambling to fix it?

As someone who also doesn't like asking for help when I've screwed up, I sympathized with her plight and left her to figure it out on her own. I considered going in and asking how things were going, but I didn't want to micromanage her or rush her. I also felt extreme guilt at even having her there at all. She had already gotten suckered into working much longer than she expected, and I was now here she was approaching hour 13 of her workday because some idiot expected her to reconstruct his keyboard.

At 11pm, I walked by the kitchen to go to the bathroom and tried to subtly peek in to see what was going on. Most of the keys were still outside the keyboard, but Jaclyn S.'s back was to me blocking the keyboard, so I couldn't see much.

She had to finish eventually, so I just waited. 11:30pm, she's still working. The sounds of the work still sound anxious.

By 11:45pm, she had been there almost three hours. The work sounded like it was wrapping up. Just before midnight, she came out carrying my keyboard. It was spic 'n span and all put back together. I thanked her for her work and plugged my keyboard back in. Everything worked fine.

I checked the receipt. Out of curiosity, I checked the cost of buying that same keyboard brand new. About $40. So I had spent $90 cleaning a $40 keyboard.

## It's not *that* dumb

This is a story that I jokingly told to family and friends for years. And they dutifully bring it up any time I give them financial advice.

But it's not as dumb as it might seem. People ask why I didn't just clean the keyboard myself instead of spending almost $100. Assuming that my time is worth more than $26/hr, it still "costs" me ~$100 to do it myself, even though no money is changing hands.

There's also the obvious solution of buying a brand new keyboard and throwing the dirty one in the trash. But I just don't want to be so wasteful to throw out perfectly functional items just because they're dirty.

If I had to do this again, I'd post the old keyboard for free on craigslist or my local [buy nothing](https://buynothingproject.org) group. It's not as time efficient as throwing the item away because people who reply to those listings tend to be flaky, so it's a pain to arrange pickups, but it's better than just adding working electronics to a landfill.

## Outsourcing doesn't scale down

The lesson I took from this is that outsourcing works poorly for small, one-off tasks. If I had to clean my keyboard every three days, then it would make sense to outsource it all to Jaclyn S. As a one time job, I saved myself three hours of cleaning my keyboard, but I lost a few hours arranging it and stressing about what was going on while she worked.
