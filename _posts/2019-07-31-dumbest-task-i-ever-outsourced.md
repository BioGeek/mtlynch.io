I once gave someone a cheap, dirty keyboard and $96 cash in exchange for $0 and an identical but slightly cleaner keyboard. Looking back, it wasn't my best trade.

## It all started with a writing class

Back in 2016, I lived in a small studio apartment in Manhattan. It was a Monday night, and I was sitting in front of my computer trying to write a short story. I hadn't written fiction since graduating high school a decade earlier, but I missed it, so I signed up for a class nearby in Brooklyn.

At least, I *thought* I missed writing. The story was due at 9 AM the next day. All of my story ideas felt terrible. I was cursing my decision to take this class and looking for any distraction from my assignment.

I became fixated on my keyboard. It was so dusty and grimy. How had I not noticed this before? I had the same keyboard for five or six years, typing on it 20-30 hours per week, eating all my meals in front of it. Growing up, my parents (both programmers) routinely popped all the keys off of our keyboards to deep clean them in rubbing alcohol. Did people still do that?

I should do that!

No, I couldn't do that. I'd never finish my story.

I admitted to myself that I was simply procrastinating, but the only way I could stop was to make a deal with myself that I'd deal with it for real after submitting the story.

## Gig economy to the rescue

At the time, I was making good money working for Google, but I felt constantly short on time. Outsourcing seemed like the solution. If there was a task that would bring me no pleasure to do myself, and it would take more than an hour, I'd try to hire someone to do it instead.

[TaskRabbit](https://www.taskrabbit.com) is one of the popular apps for the gig economy. It allows users to book one-off tasks like cleaning an apartment or mounting a TV. "Keyboard deep cleaning" didn't seem to be one of their pre-defined jobs, so I booked the job as "Small cleaning" and explained in the description that I wanted someone to clean my keyboard. TaskRabbit has a one-hour minimum, and I was afraid my keyboard task wouldn't take the full hour, so I also said I wanted the person to clean some dishes I had piled up in the sink.

## Must have at least 15 years of keyboard cleaning experience

Many of the people who responded to my TaskRabbit job were confused.

One applicant told me that they wanted to be up front in that they have no keyboard cleaning experience. I told them it was fine. All they really needed to do was take out the keys, swab them with rubbing alcohol, and put them back.

Another told me she was pregnant and wanted to make sure cleaning the keyboard didn't require heavy lifting. I assured her that I had one of those fancy, modern keyboards that weighs less than 35 pounds.

Finally, I received an offer from Jaclyn S. She had supreme confidence in her ability to clean the keyboard and wanted to know only what supplies to bring with her. Within 20 minutes, I booked her for 3pm the following day.

## Cleaning day

The next day, Jaclyn S. messaged me around 1pm saying that her morning job exploded into a 10-hour task. She wouldn't be able to make our 3pm appointment and wanted to know if we could reschedule for the following day. I asked if she had any availability later in the day and she . She said she could come at 9pm if that worked, or we'd have to rebook for another day. I already planned work to do on my laptop while she was there, so I didn't want to reschedule. I decided to just let her come at 9pm.

I was annoyed, but only because the reschedule forced me to admit to myself and to Jaclyn S that I, a 31-year-old guy living in Manhattan, had nothing better to do on a Saturday night than watch someone clean my keyboard.

Jaclyn S. arrived just after 8:30pm. At the time, I lived in a small studio apartment in Manhattan. If she cleaned the keyboard in my living room / bedroom, it would feel awkward just sitting three feet away from her and pretending to ignore her while I worked. I figured it would give us both privacy if she worked in the kitchen, which was separated from the bedroom by a wall.

## Timeline

Here's how the events played out.

### 8:35pm, 5 minutes elapsed

I put the keyboard in the kitchen along with a few days' worth of dirty dishes. I gave her Q-Tips, paper towels, and a bottle of rubbing alcohol for the keyboard. I showed her how to pop the plastic keys out of the keyboard. I rolled a spare office chair into the kitchen so that she could sit comfortably in front of my cabinets as she worked.

Giving her privacy, I went back to work in my bedroom. I heard her start on the dishes. So far so good.

### 9pm: 0.5 hours elapsed

I hear the sink turn off and the sounds of keys being popped off my keyboard. Great! Everything's on schedule.

### 9:30pm: 1 hour elapsed

Okay, she's been on the keyboard for half an hour. She'll probably be done any minute now.

### 10:00pm, 1.5 hours elapsed

*Any* minute now.

### 10:15pm: 1.75 hours elapsed

The sounds coming from the kitchen sound panicked, like someone who screwed up and didn't want to ask for help.  Was she having trouble putting the keys back in? Did she break something and was scrambling to fix it? Maybe I'm just projecting.

As someone who also doesn't like asking for help when I've screwed up, I sympathized with her plight and left her to figure it out on her own. I considered going in and asking how things were going, but I didn't want to micromanage her or rush her. I also felt extreme guilt at even having her there at all. She had already gotten suckered into working much longer than she expected, and I was now here she was approaching hour 13 of her workday because some idiot expected her to reconstruct his keyboard.

### 11pm: 2.5 hours elapsed

I walk by the kitchen on my way to the bathroom and try to subtly peek in to see what was going on. Most of the keys were still outside the keyboard, but Jaclyn S.'s back is to me blocking the keyboard, so I couldn't see much.

She had to finish eventually, so I just wait. I feel like I should ask her if she needs help, but I'm also feeling tremendously guilty about making this poor woman sit in my kitchen at 11pm on a Saturday night scrubbing a keyboard.

### 11:30pm: 3 hours elapsed

She's still working. The sounds of the work still sound anxious.

### 11:45pm, 3.25 hours elapsed

There's something victorious in the sounds of her work now. Surely, it's almost over.

### 12am: 3.5 hours elapsed

Jaclyn S. came out carrying my keyboard. It was spic 'n span and all put back together. I thank her for her work and plug my keyboard back in. Everything works fine.

## The bill

I checked the receipt.

Out of curiosity, I checked the cost of buying that same keyboard brand new: $38.89. 

{% include image.html file="keyboard-order.jpg" alt="$38.89 receipt for purchasing my keyboard brand new" max_width="750px" img_link=true fig_caption="TaskRabbit receipt from my keyboard cleaning task" %}

I spent $96 to clean a $39 keyboard.

## It's not *that* dumb

The reaction from many people when they hear this story is that they'd never waste so much money hiring a keyboard cleaner because they'd just clean it themselves. They're missing the point.

A helpful way of evaluating whether to outsource something is to ask yourself how much someone would have to pay *you* to do the task. At the time, I was rolling in money from my cushy Google job but desperate for free time. For me to sacrifice my limited personal time to clean someone's keyboard, they'd have to pay me well above $100/hr. So it would be illogical for me to clean my keyboard when others are willing to do it for far less.

That said, there's obviously something hinky with spending almost a hundred dollars to clean a keyboard worth a fraction of that amount, so what went wrong here?

## Lessons learned

### Outsourcing doesn't scale down

Between the time I spent arranging the job and feeling distracted by the poor woman stuck in my kitchen for three hours, it cost me more time to outsource this task than to do it myself. For any outsourced task, there's some frictional cost of defining the job and finding a candidate. For small, one-time tasks, the frictional costs can occupy more time than the job itself.

Now, my minimum is around five hours unless it's a task I really hate. Recurring tasks work much better, especially if you create a process that minimizes friction if a new person takes over.

### Invest more in training

It shouldn't really take three hours to clean a keyboard. It was dirty, but not three hours dirty. Three hours is like the time it would take to clean it if I accidentally dropped my keyboard into a vat of molasses.

I suspect that my cleaner was cleaning each key way more thoroughly than I needed and/or she got stuck trying to put the keyboard back together and was afraid to ask for help. I could have prevented both by giving her more instructions up front and letting her know it's okay to watch YouTube videos or ask me for guidance.

### There's always craigslist

I knew up front that the cost of cleaning the keyboard might exceed its value, but the only alternative I considered was throwing away a perfectly good keyboard.

If I had to do this again, I'd buy a new keyboard and post the old one for free on craigslist or my local [buy nothing group](https://buynothingproject.org).

**Sidenote**: People have suggested donating items like this to The Salvation Army, but I prefer directly finding people who want the item. I suspect that sending a low-value item through The Salvation Army's whole receiving, processing, displaying, and selling process is a net negative.
