title: The Dumbest Task I Ever Outsourced

The shameful secret about my writing is that I hate writing. When it's time for me to write something, every task that is not writing seems infinitely more interesting than writing.

As a way to procrastinate writing (under the guise of thinking), I used to pace around my apartment. Invariably, I'd find something else to do instead of writing. My solution was to restrict myself to my desk. When it was time to write, I forced myself to sit at my computer and only get up to get a drink or use the bathroom. I wasn't allowed to check my phone or social media.

But I still found ways to procrastinate at my desk. The cleanliness of my keyboard, usually not a concern, but when the alternative was writing, I became *highly* concerned with the cleanliness of my keyboard. I'd run a folded up piece of paper between the keys and be aghast at all the gunk that it pulled up.

Eventually, I recognized this as just another procrastination technique and forced myself to stop cleaning my keyboard when I had to write.

Still, I felt like there was something there. When did I buy this keyboard? Five years ago? Six? I had never cleaned it seriously, so who knows what gross stuff was building inside. I could just throw it out and buy a new one for $30, but that seemed egregiously wasteful way of solving the problem. The keyboard still functioned fine, so I shuddered at the thought of adding it to a landfill just because it had gotten a little grimy over the years.

## This seems like a job for outsourcing

At the time, I was also really into the idea of outsourcing. My job paid a lot, so I had lots of money but frequently found myself pressed for time. Outsourcing seemed like a brilliant way to trade my excess money to address my shortage of time.

I was using a home cleaning app called XXX. I should just hire someone from the app to sit down and clean it. But the minimum you could book was one hour. How long would it take someone to clean my keyboard. Twenty minutes? Forty?

I decided to list the job as cleaning dishes *plus* cleaning a keyboard. That way, I wouldn't be wasting any excess time in the hour.

I posted the job and people seemed confused. They told me that they had dish cleaning experience but no keyboard cleaning experience, so was that okay? One woman said she was interested, but was pregnant, so how heavy was this keyboard? I told them it was fine and that all they really needed to do was take out the keys, scrub them with rubbing alcohol, dry them, and put them back.

## The job

Jaclyn S. agreed to take my job. She was scheduled to arrive Saturday at 3pm. She messaged me around 1pm saying that her morning job exploded into a 10-hour task, so she wouldn't be able to make it by 3pm and wanted to know if we could reschedule for the following day. I asked if she had any availability later in the day and she . She said she could come at 9pm if that worked, or we'd have to rebook for another day. I already planned work to do on my laptop while she was there, so I didn't want to reschedule. I decided to just let her come at 9pm.

Jaclyn S. arrived a little after 9pm. At the time, I lived in a small studio apartment in Manhattan. If she cleaned the keyboard in my living room / bedroom, it would feel awkward just sitting three feet away from her and pretending to ignore her while I worked. I figured it would give us both privacy if she worked in the kitchen, which was separated from the bedroom by a wall.

I put the keyboard in the kitchen along with a few days' worth of dirty dishes. I gave her Q-Tips, paper towels, and a bottle of rubbing alcohol for the keyboard. I showed her how to pop the plastic keys out of the keyboard. I rolled a spare office chair into the kitchen so that she could sit comfortably in front of my cabinets as she worked.

Giving her privacy, I went back to work in my bedroom. I heard her start on the dishes. So far so good. A half hour later, I heard the sink turn off and began hearing the sounds of keys being popped off my keyboard. Great! Everything was going according to schedule.

At around 10pm, I began preparing to hear her come out and declare victory. By 10:15pm, I figured she'd be done any minute now. I continued feeling that way until 10:45pm.

## Is everything going okay?

I'm not sure if I'm just projecting, but the sounds coming from the kitchen sounded panicked, like someone who screwed up and didn't want to ask for help. Was she having trouble putting the keys back in? Did she break something and was scrambling to fix it?

As someone who also doesn't like asking for help when I've screwed up, I sympathized with her plight and left her to figure it out on her own. I considered going in and asking how things were going, but I didn't want to micromanage her or rush her. I also felt extreme guilt at even having her there at all. She had already gotten suckered into working much longer than she expected, and I was now here she was approaching hour 13 of her workday because some idiot expected her to reconstruct his keyboard.

At 11pm, I walked by the kitchen to go to the bathroom and tried to subtly peek in to see what was going on. Most of the keys were still outside the keyboard, but Jaclyn S.'s back was to me blocking the keyboard, so I couldn't see much.

She had to finish eventually, so I just waited. 11:30pm, she's still working. The sounds of the work still sound anxious.

By 11:45pm, she had been there almost three hours. The work sounded like it was wrapping up. Just before midnight, she came out carrying my keyboard. It was spic 'n span and all put back together. I thanked her for her work and plugged my keyboard back in. Everything worked fine.

I checked the receipt. Out of curiosity, I checked the cost of buying that same keyboard brand new. About $40. So I had spent $90 cleaning a $40 keyboard.

## Not as dumb as it seems

This is a story that I jokingly told to family and friends for years. And when I talk to them about outsourcing, they jokingly say, "Oh, tell me again about how I should spend $100 to clean a $40 keyboard."

But I maintain that this story is not as dumb as it seems. Sure, I could have just bought a new keyboard instead of cleaning the old one, but that wouldn't have solved my problem. One of my constraints is that I didn't want to throw away a perfectly good keyboard. If my time was worth more than $26/hr, and I'm no more skilled at cleaning keyboards than Jaclyn S., then it was the right decision to hire her, even though the cost was ridiculous relative to the cost of the keyboard itself.

If I were to do it over, I would have just bought the new keyboard and listed the old one in the criagslist free section. I left NYC about a year ago, and I now live in a small town where craigslist isn't so popular, but there is an active [buy nothing](https://buynothingproject.org) group, where people will often take unwanted but still functional items. The problem with both of these is that the people who accept stuff are generally flaky and kind of waste time by failing to show up or demanding I hand deliver the item to their house.

## Outsourcing doesn't scale down

The lesson I took from this is that outsourcing doesn't scale down very well. I saved myself the three hours of cleaning my keyboard, but I also lost an hour or two in scheduling the task and stressing about what was going on while she was working.

Outsourcing small tasks works fine if they're repeated. Like my house cleaner takes only about 90 minutes to clean my house, but it's a regular pattern now, so I have to do very little in terms of management.
