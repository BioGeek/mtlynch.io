I'm constantly trying to convince my friends to outsource. Many of them work high-paying jobs and find themselves with too little free time, but they won't listen to me sing the praises of outsourcing. I think it's because they know about the time I paid someone $96 to clean a $39 to keyboard.

## It all started with a writing class

Back in 2016, I lived in a small studio apartment in Manhattan. It was a Monday night, and I was sitting in front of my computer trying to write a short story. I hadn't written fiction since high school, but I had signed up for a writing class. My first story was due at 9 AM the next day.

Desperate for any distraction, I became fixated on my keyboard. It was so dusty and grimy. How had I not noticed this before? I had the same keyboard for five or six years, typing on it 20-30 hours per week, eating all my meals in front of it.

Growing up, my parents routinely popped all the keys off of our keyboards to deep clean them in rubbing alcohol. Did people still do that?

I should do that!

No, I'd never finish my story. I recognized my procrastination for what it was, but the only way I could focus was to promise myself that I'd address the dirty keyboard later that week.

## Outsource all the things

At the time, I was making good money working for Google, but I felt constantly short on time. A few friends had told me they had used an app called [TaskRabbit](https://www.taskrabbit.com) to book workers for short, one-off tasks like mounting a TV or waiting in a long line.

This seemed like the ideal time to try out for this service, so I signed up. To my surprise, their pre-defined job templates had no entry for "keyboard deep cleaning," so I booked the job as "Small cleaning" and explained in the description that I wanted someone to clean my keyboard. I wasn't sure if cleaning the keyboard would fill up TaskRabbit's one hour minimum, so I requested that the cleaner also take care of some dishes that had piled up in my sink.

## Must have at least 15 years of keyboard cleaning experience

Many of the people who responded to my TaskRabbit job were confused.

One applicant told me that she wanted to be up front in that she had "zero keyboard cleaning experience." I assured her that was okay. She only had to take out the keys, wipe them with rubbing alcohol, and put them back.

Another candidate was pregnant and needed to know whether the job required heavy lifting. I promised her that mine was one of those fancy, modern keyboards that weighs less than 35 pounds.

Finally, I received an offer from Jaclyn S. She approached the job with supreme confidence and had no questions except for what supplies to bring. Within 20 minutes, we had booked the job for 3pm the following day.

## The first hiccup

The next day, Jaclyn S. messaged me around 1pm saying that her morning job exploded into a 10-hour task. She wouldn't be able to make our 3pm appointment and said we could either reschedule for 9pm that evening or 3pm the following day.

This was irritating. Was Jaclyn S. implying that I, a young man in one of Manhattan's trendiest neighborhoods, had nothing better to do on a Saturday night than watch someone clean my keyboard?

It was irritating because it was true. I told her 9pm was fine and awaited her arrival.

## Timeline

Jaclyn S. arrived just after 8:30pm. Here's the play-by-play of how the evening went:

### 8:35pm, 5 minutes elapsed

I show Jaclyn S. to the kitchen, where there are a few days' worth of dirty dishes in the sink. Next to the sink, my keyboard is on a table, alongside Q-Tips, paper towels, and a bottle of rubbing alcohol. I roll in an extra office chair, show her how to pop keys off the keyboard, and tell her that I'll be on the other side of the kitchen wall if she has any questions.

### 8:36pm, 6 minutes elapsed

Returning to the desk in my bedroom / living room, I hear my sink turn on and the sound of dish scrubbing.

### 9pm: 0.5 hours elapsed

The sink turns off, and I hear the distinct noise of keys popping off a keyboard. Everything is on schedule.

### 9:30pm: 1 hour elapsed

Okay, she's been on the keyboard for half an hour. She'll probably be done any minute now.

### 10:00pm, 1.5 hours elapsed

*Any* minute now.

### 10:15pm: 1.75 hours elapsed

The sounds coming from the kitchen sound panicked, like someone who screwed up and didn't want to ask for help.  Is she having trouble putting the keys back in? Has something broken, and she's scrambling to fix it? Maybe I'm just projecting.

### 10:30pm, 2 hours elapsed

Should I go in and ask her what's taking so long? I want to, but the situation makes me feel tremendously guilty. Because of me, she's now entering hour 13 of her workday and she's stuck scrubbing a keyboard late into the night because some idiot was too lazy to do it himself.

### 11pm: 2.5 hours elapsed

On my way to the bathroom, I sneak a peek into the kitchen to see what's going on. Most of the keys are still outside the keyboard, but Jaclyn S. is sitting between me and the table, so I can't see much.

This has to end eventually, so I'll see what happens.

### 11:30pm: 3 hours elapsed

What if this *never* ends?

What if I have to go to sleep with Jaclyn S. still cleaning my keyboard? What if years go by? I'll get married and have children, then have to explain to them this woman who lives in my kitchen, eternally cleaning my precious Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000.

Hmm, this might be my sleepiness talking.

### 12am: 3.5 hours elapsed

Jaclyn S. emerges from my kitchen, triumphantly carrying my keyboard. It is sparkling clean. I thank her for her work and plug my keyboard back in. Everything works fine.

## The bill

The final cost for Jaclyn's three and a half hours of keyboard cleaning: $95.55.

Out of curiosity, I checked what I paid for that keyboard brand new: $38.89. 

{% include image.html file="keyboard-order.jpg" alt="$38.89 receipt for purchasing my keyboard brand new" max_width="500px" class="img-border" img_link=true fig_caption="Amazon receipt for my keyboard" %}

I spent $96 to clean a $39 keyboard.

## It's not *that* dumb

My friends smugly remarked, "Oh, *I'd* never spend $100 to clean a keyboard. I'd just do it myself." They're missing the point.

A helpful way of evaluating whether to outsource something is to ask yourself how much someone would have to pay *you* to do the task. At the time, I was rolling in money from my cushy Google job but desperate for free time. For me to sacrifice my limited personal time to clean someone's keyboard, they'd have to pay me well above $100/hr. It would be illogical for me to clean my keyboard when others are willing to do it for far less.

That said, there's obviously something hinky going on when an item's routine maintenance costs far exceed its value, so what went wrong here?

## Lessons learned

### Outsourcing doesn't scale down

Between the time I spent arranging the job and feeling distracted by the poor woman stuck in my kitchen for almost four hours, it cost me more time to outsource this task than to do it myself.

For any outsourced task, there are frictional costs of defining the job, finding a candidate, and managing their work. For small, one-time tasks, the frictional costs can be a large enough proportion of the total job time that it negates the benefit of outsourcing.

### Invest more in training

The keyboard needed a good cleaning, but not *three hours* of cleaning. Three hours is like if I asked her to clean my keyboard after dipping it in a vat of molasses.

It's possible that my cleaner washed each key more thoroughly than was necessary. Perhaps she got stuck trying to put the keyboard back together and was afraid to ask for help. I could have prevented either by giving her more instructions up front and letting her know it's okay to watch YouTube videos or ask me for guidance.

### There's always craigslist

I knew up front that the cost of cleaning the keyboard might exceed its value, but the only alternative I considered was throwing away a perfectly good keyboard and buying the same model brand new.

If I had to do this again, I'd buy a new keyboard and offer the old one for free to an online community like [craigslist](https://craigslist.org) or my local [buy nothing group](https://buynothingproject.org).

**Sidenote**: People have suggested donating it to The Salvation Army, but I don't think it makes sense for such a cheap item. For higher-value items, I happily donate. For low-value items, I suspect that sending it through The Salvation Army's whole receiving, processing, displaying, and selling process is a net negative.
