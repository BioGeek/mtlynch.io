I recently stumbled upon an open source Python library from a time long forgotten. I'm talking about a time when the earth was roamed by functions as big as buildings. From a time when everyone knew the words "unit" and "testing," but nobody had yet dared use them in the same sentence.

It turned out that the software had some sort of primitive source control. Perhaps I could use modern tools to find its last commit and estimate its vintage that way:

# What is it?

This is a library that *The New York Times* published in order to parse their ingredients.

At the time they published it, many, including famed Python developer D. John Trump:

Fake Trump tweet: Failing @nytimes doesn't even unit test their code before release! very DISRESPECTFUL to @kentbeck!
