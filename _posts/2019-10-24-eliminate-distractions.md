title: "Tricks for Reducing Distractions from Gmail, Social Media, and StackOverflow"
---

This isn't another "you should quit social media" blog post. You can use email and social media in healthy ways. The challenge is that they actively struggle with you to induce you to use them in unhealthy ways. This post is about techniques that help you manage these tools instead of allowing them to manage you. Some are simple technical tricks. Others are personal habits.

## Avoid "drag"

Apps that when you use them, they drag you into other stuff.

* You decide to respond to a recent email, but you open Gmail and see four new emails.
* You take out your phone to check the time and see that you have six notifications from four different apps.
* You check your Twitter feed for interesting blog posts and instead spend three hours reading about the latest trending controversy that everyone will forget about in a week.

## Decide what you want from social media

You can manage the cost of social media.

People talk about social media as if it's always a negative thing and you need to eliminate it. But social media can be a useful thing. I like to see when my Facebook friends get married or have babies. I don't want to use Facebook for mindlessly watching videos or getting into political arguments. I like to see when interesting people I follow on Twitter post useful blog articles or advice.

Think about what you want out of social media and if there's a way to get it. I can use Twitter for my stated purpose by checking it once a day in a 5-15 minute block. Same with Facebook.

## Schedule time for email, texts, and social media

If you've taken some time to reflect on what you want from social media, hopefully your answer isn't, "Email and social media are my taskmasters, so I must check in with them every 15 minutes to decide on my next task." No, once you decide what you want from those tools and how much time you need to invest to get that benefit, schedule it.

This is easiest with social media because there's rarely urgent, critical tasks that result from you checking your Facebook feed.

I'm more present in social situations. I was always a firm believer in "don't interrupt a real life interaction to check your phone." But if my friend went to the bathroom or they had to take a call or something, I'd check my email and texts. I didn't think anything of it, but I realized a huge difference once I committed to not doing that.

Checked Twitter and was in a bad mood because someone said something I found really obnoxious.

I check once I get home.

I schedule

Social media becomes less interesting

Don't check your texts in social situations or during brief breaks.

## Twitter

### Make Twitter's trending hashtags boring

{% include image.html file="twitter-trending.jpg" alt="Twitter's trending topics" max_width="800px" img_link=true class="img-border" fig_caption="Twitter shows you trending topics to seduce you into spending more time in the app." %}

Set Twitter's trending news to a location where you don't speak the language and you're not interested in their news. Mine is set to Abu Dhabi.

{% include image.html file="twitter-settings.jpg" alt="Twitter's trending topics" max_width="600px" img_link=true fig_caption="Twitter shows you trending topics to seduce you into spending more time in the app." %}

{% include image.html file="abu-dhabi-trends.jpg" alt="Twitter's trending topics" max_width="352px" img_link=true fig_caption="Twitter shows you trending topics to seduce you into spending more time in the app." %}

### Mute, block, and unfollow your way to a tidy Twitter feed

I enjoyed following celebrities and comedians because they were entertaining, but I realized they were distracting me from my intended purpose on Twitter, which is to maintain professional connections and see when people post interesting technical content.

Review your the list of accounts you follow on Twitter. Eliminate ones that post a low proportion of relevant content.

{% assign fig_caption = "Use [muted words](https://twitter.com/settings/muted_keywords) to filter out current events and topics you're uninterested in engaging with on Twitter." | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="twitter-muted.jpg" alt="Twitter's trending topics" max_width="600px" img_link=true fig_caption=fig_caption %}

I think the news is important, but Twitter is not an effective way for me to consume it.

Block celebrities and politicians.

## StackOverflow / StackExchange

### Ignore "hot questions"

Joke StackOverflow questions:
  * One of my co-workers has no reflection and is constantly drinking blood. Is It Elizabeth Holmes?
  * My (married) manager is currently having a heart attack. Is it inappropriate for me to perform CPR?
  * Accidentally proved P=NP

Only in writing this article did I realize StackExchange offers a setting so you can disable this natively. In Site Settings > Preferences, you can check "Hide Hot Network Questions":

{% assign fig_caption = 'Disable "Hot Network Questions" in [StackOverflow settings](https://stackoverflow.com/users/preferences/) to eliminate distracting questions.' | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="stackoverflow-settings.jpg" alt="Screenshot of StackOverflow's settings page" max_width="800px" img_link=true class="img-border" fig_caption=fig_caption %}

## Email

### Hide your Gmail inbox

A frequent source

[Inbox When Ready](https://inboxwhenready.org/).

If you use a mail client like Outlook or Thunderbird, you can replicate this by disabling automatic e-mail checking.

Haven't solved this on the phone

You can still allow through high-priority emails. You can still check on high-priority threads with search.

### Move your to-do list out of your inbox

At this point, "don't use your inbox as a to-do list" is pretty cliche advice, but I'll say it anyway. The biggest problem is that if your inbox and your to-do list are the same thing, it's impossible for you to check your to-do list without seeing new emails come in.

Use a to-do list instead. I use Nirvana, which I think is okay not great. I've heard good things about Todoist.

Data remanence.

It's bad at prioritizing

### Unbundle Hangouts from Gmail

{% include image.html file="hangouts-in-gmail.jpg" alt="Chat settings in Gmail" max_width="800px" img_link=true class="img-border" fig_caption="By default, Gmail embeds Hangouts into your inbox." %}

{% assign fig_caption = "Disabling chat in [Gmail settings](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/chat)" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="gmail-disable-chat.jpg" alt="Chat settings in Gmail" max_width="821px" img_link=true class="img-border" fig_caption=fig_caption %}

## Browse social media with a dedicated browser profile

* Uninstall social media apps from your phone
* Move social media into separate browser profiles
* Lock down social media from the browser to limit tracking

## Set your phone to "Do Not Disturb" forever

My phone has been continuously on "Do Not Disturb" mode for the last 18 months. No apps can send me notifications.

Did this by mistake.

Tried to whitelist callers but it didn't work.

## Replace texts with phone calls

Texts are hard because there's no equivalent of Inbox When Ready for texting.

## Replace online communities with real-life meetups

I met my friend [David Toth](https://twitter.com/jupiterunknown) at an Indie Hackers meetup in Manhattan. David lives in Western Massachusetts. I later asked him why 

There's something so different about meeting someone in person. There are people I met at meetups one time more than a year ago and we still keep in touch and help each other out. Meanwhile, there are people who I've probably spent 10x that time engaging.

It's there and you're done. On reddit or a online forum, you're constantly pulled back in.

David and I now organize the Indie Hackers meetup for Western Mass. We weren't sure if anyone would come, but worst case scenario, it's just us hanging out together. We generally draw a crowd of 6-10 people.

## Accept boredom

* Talk about *Deep Work* ([my notes](/book-reports/deep-work/))

## Starting is the hardest part

The hardest part is starting these habits, but once I did them for a few days, they become exponentially easier. One of the earliest things I did was to defer checking my email until 10 am instead of right when I woke up. It felt so difficult, and I kept feeling compelled to check my email to satisfy my curiosity about what's there.

After a week, I no longer felt the temptation when I woke up. By two weeks, I almost dreaded checking my email. My mornings had become so peaceful and productive. Once I checked my email, I was opening the door to whatever stresses awaited me there.

Today, I don't check my email until after I eat lunch.

## If you backslide, just start over

Some days, I'm obsessively checking texts and email. It feeds on itself.

## Be vigilant

Notice apps that drag you back in. Eliminate distractions and put obstacles in front of them.
