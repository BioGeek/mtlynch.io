title: "Tricks for Reducing Distractions from Gmail, Social Media, and StackOverflow"
---

This isn't another "you should quit social media" blog post. You can use email and social media in healthy ways. The challenge is that they actively struggle with you to induce you to use them in unhealthy ways. This post is about techniques that help you manage these tools instead of allowing them to manage you. Some are simple technical tricks. Others are personal habits.

## Avoid "drag"

Apps that when you use them, they drag you into other stuff.

* You decide to respond to a recent email, but you open Gmail and see four new emails.
* You take out your phone to check the time and see that you have six notifications from four different apps.
* You check your Twitter feed for interesting blog posts and instead spend three hours reading about the latest trending controversy that everyone will forget about in a week.

## You don't have to quit social media

You can manage the cost of social media.

## Make Twitter's trending hashtags boring

Set Twitter's trending news to a location where you don't speak the language and you're not interested in their news. Mine is set to Abu Dhabi.

## Mute, block, and unfollow your way to a tidy Twitter feed

Review your the list of accounts you follow on Twitter. Eliminate ones that post a low proportion of relevant content or that you don't care that much about.

Use mute words to avoid current events.

Block celebrities and politicians.

## Hide StackOverflow / StackExchange: ignore "hot" questions

Joke StackOverflow questions:
  * One of my co-workers has no reflection and is constantly drinking blood. Is It Elizabeth Holmes?
  * My (married) manager is currently having a heart attack. Is it inappropriate for me to perform CPR?
  * Accidentally proved P=NP

## Hide your Gmail inbox

Inbox when ready

Haven't solved this on the phone

You can still allow through high-priority emails. You can still check on high-priority threads with search.

## Unbundle Hangouts from Gmail

{% assign fig_caption = "Disabling chat in [Gmail settings](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/chat)" | markdownify | remove: "<p>" | remove: "</p>" %}

{% include image.html file="gmail-disable-chat.jpg" alt="Chat settings in Gmail" max_width="821px" img_link=true class="img-border" fig_caption=fig_caption %}

## Break your bad habits with obstacles

* Uninstall social media apps from your phone
* Move social media into separate browser profiles
* Lock down social media from the browser to limit tracking

## Move your to-do list out of your inbox

At this point, "don't use your inbox as a to-do list" is pretty cliche advice, but I'll say it anyway. The biggest problem is that if your inbox and your to-do list are the same thing, it's impossible for you to check your to-do list without seeing new emails come in.

Use a to-do list instead. I use Nirvana, which I think is okay not great. I've heard good things about Todoist.

Data remanence.

It's bad at prioritizing

## Schedule time for social media

I schedule

Social media becomes less interesting

## Set your phone to "Do Not Disturb" forever

My phone has been continuously on "Do Not Disturb" mode for the last 18 months. No apps can send me notifications.

Did this by mistake.

Tried to whitelist callers but it didn't work

## Replace texts with phone calls

Texts are hard because there's no equivalent of Inbox When Ready for texting.

## Replace online communities with real-life meetups

Technique I stole from my friend [David Toth](https://twitter.com/jupiterunknown).

## Accept boredom

* Talk about *Deep Work*

## Starting is the hardest part

When I first started waiting until after noon

## If you backslide, just start over

Some days, I'm obsessively checking texts and email. It feeds on itself.
