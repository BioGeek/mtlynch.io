title: Why I Fired 10 Content Writers (and Hired a Good One)

For my last project, I interviewed 30 writers, hired 10 of them, and fired all but one. This process was far more difficult than I expected. Almost every adult can write, so how hard could it be to find someone to write simple articles?

This process has not made me an expert, but I'm much better than I was. In this post, I'll show you everything I did

This is not a guide for people who want to fill their site with cheap content so that they appear highly in search results for particular terms. This guide is for people who care about quality writing and want to work with writers who can produce it.

# The golden rule of hiring

The underlying strategy that defines most of how I hire and work with writers:

* **Talented people are selective about which jobs they take**

When I see articles that recommend forcing writers through a rigorous screening process that includes doing lots of unpaid work, I think, "Sounds like a good way to filter out all the good writers."

Create work conditions that are fair, pleasant, and interesting enough that good writers want to come work for you. Show candidates that you respect and value their craft. This starts from the first message you send and continues throughout the working relationship.

# Create a detailed job description

The first step in finding candidates is defining what kind of writer you want.

Remember the golden rule. A good description shows candidates. It should be clear and organized so that candidates see that you're a professional. It shouldn't be so long and meticulously detailed that you seem like an insane control freak.

* Overview
   * What kind of content will they write?
   * What is the goal of the content?
     * Is it to attract attention to a product? Is it to improve search engine rankings for a keyword? Is it to build a personal or business brand?
* Requirements
  * Do they require specialized knowledge?
  * Should they have particular skills (e.g., writing for SEO, appealing to a certain demographic)?
* Timing
  * How many hours per week do you expect them to put in each week?
  * How quickly must the writer complete assignments?
* Payment
  * What method of payment will you use and how quickly can writers expect to receive payment?
  * Do you need to collect tax information from them? (in the US, you'll need to collect a 1099 from them if you pay them more than $600 per year)

Show examples of what kind of content you want. This can be from your own site or from another site whose content is something you're using as inspiration.

Caveat: When you show writers example articles, they will naturally take those to be the template for what you want. If there are aspects of the examples you don't like, call those out.

Remember that freelance writers generally have to juggle multiple clients at once. If you're flexible about timing, it's easier to find good writers who can fit you into their schedule.

* Examples of what you want or don't want (be careful what you wish for because they're going to use it as a template). Be real specific about what you don't like.

# Finding writers


Create a contract.

## Upwork

The advantage to Upwork is that they have a contract built-in that assigns you rights to the work you hire for, so you don't need to create your own contract. They also handle all the billing and taxes, so you don't need to collect tax information from your hires.

The downside is that if you find someone through Upwork, the Upwork Terms of Use requires you to work with them exclusively through Upwork and pay Upwork fees 

The balance of power on Upwork is definitely skewed far in favor of the client. If you're unhappy with the work, you can demand a refund. This may sound good for you, but it also discourages good writers from using the platform because they don't want to be at the mercy of an unprofessional client who's empowered by the skewed platform.

## Professional referrals



## Flyers

My town of South Hadley is nearby many liberal arts colleges. I thought maybe I could find a talented college student, so I put up flyers in my town and on Mt. Holyoke's campus. I received only one serious applicant, and their writing samples were just poorly-written school assignments, so I didn't have much success with this, but I also should have tried additional colleges.

## /r/hireawriter

There's a subreddit dedicated to hiring freelance writers, but I never found anyone

# Pay per hour, pay per word, or pay per piece?

There are several 

Good writers want to produce good writing

Assumes that writers are lazy, so you need to impose financial penalties on them to prevent that (i.e., withhold their pay until the article is completed to your satisfaction).

One of my writers told me that she clocks out when she gets up to use the bathroom or get a drink of water and I told her that was crazy.  If someone is producing good work for me, I don't care if they spent an hour writing the article or they took a walk to clear their head for forty minutes, then wrote the article in twenty. In my experience, if you show people that you trust them to do good work and be honest, they'll do it.

# Sending offers

Invest time in screening. When you invite people to apply, mention specifics about their stuff.

# Evaluating candidates

Don't hope that you can fix bad writers. They're going to stay the same.

# Use a style guide to enforce consistency

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uy19xtf_PFW0LJ2Zj6cSkH2dhHED8PCjHCtup1_IQ_4/edit#heading=h.qwnjmopyhpr6

Make it a Google Doc or a wiki where there's a single, authoritative copy of it. If the style guide is in an email or a Word Document, it's hard to update and ensure that everyone's working from the same copy.

You can create this

Some writers use the term "website" and some use "web site" then your site is messy.

Iterate on the style guide as you go. Instead of just telling someone that they're making a style error, link to the style guide. Don't make it too long or it's hard for people to learn.

Pay writers to learn the style guide. If you show

# Agree on an editing workflow

Instance where I would suggest an edit and she would make more edits.

# The first few drafts

This is where the interview really begins.

* What parts take the most time?

Bad if they make the same mistakes over and over.

# Gracefully terminating bad hires

Try not to phrase it in a scary "you're about to get fired way" but like:

>What can I do to help us reduce these issues?

Here is a real letter I wrote to one of the writers that didn't work out:

>Unfortunately, I need to end the contract here. Your writing is good, but we're on our eighth article, and the style is still fairly distant from what I'd like it to be.
>
>From reading the shrimp and celery articles, it looks like it would require 2-3 rounds of review before I'd feel comfortable publishing it. At that point, it's faster for me to write the reports myself.
>
>I appreciate all your work and wish you the best going forward.

And then here is probably my harshest one:

>That's twice in a row that you promised work by a certain date and didn't deliver or give an update, so I'm afraid I need to end our relationship here.
>
>I mailed you a check on Saturday for your hours. I don't need edits on the remaining articles.
>
>Best of luck in the future.

# Meet regularly in person or on video chat

# Do it all over again

You have to work with a lot of writers to find one that you like. And with each writer you work with, you should get a better sense of what you're looking for and what you want to avoid. Before you begin interviewing again, revise your job description. Think about patterns of error with your last writer. Are there things

In my case, I noticed that I was burning a lot of time fixing grammatical errors for my writers. I thought it was a given that professional writers should use proper grammar, but in fairness, there are plenty of clients who don't care, so writers don't assume that they have to do it. Before seeking more applicants, I adjusted my job description to say that writers needed to use proper grammar. When I had subsequent writers submit content with grammatical errors, it was easier to say, "Hey, a lot of grammar errors are slipping though. Can you use a tool like Grammarly to check your writing before sending it to me?"

* Revise your job description
* Update your "example pieces"
* Re-read your style guide
  * Are there patterns of error that keep coming up that you can cover in your style guide?
