For my last project, I interviewed 30 writers, hired 10 of them, and fired all but one. This process was far more difficult than I expected. Almost every adult can write, so how hard could it be to find someone to write simple articles?

This process has not made me an expert, but I'm much better than I was. In this post, I'll show you everything I did

Throughout, I'm going to show you real examples of what I did. My site was called Is It Keto. It was a resource for people on the keto diet. Every article on the site explained why a particular food did or did not fit into the keto diet.

# About me

If you're a Fortune 500 company who can spend millions of dollars on content without noticing, your strategy will be different from a small business for whom $5k is a significant expense.

Everything in this guide is something I did myself. None of this is theoretical.

# Optimize for talent instead of cost

This is not a guide for people who want to fill their site with cheap content so that they appear highly in search results for particular terms. This guide is for people who care about quality writing and want to work with writers who can produce it.

# The fundamental principle of hiring talented people

The underlying strategy that defines most of how I hire and work with writers:

* **Talented people are selective about which jobs they take**

When I see articles that recommend forcing writers through a rigorous and unpaid screening process, I think, "What a brilliant way to filter out all the good writers."

Create work conditions that are fair, pleasant, and interesting enough that good writers want to come work for you. Show candidates that you respect and value their craft. This starts from the first message you send and continues throughout the working relationship.
