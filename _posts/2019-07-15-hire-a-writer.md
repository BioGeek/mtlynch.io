* Not a guide to hiring a cheap person to pump out words.

# A general strategy on hiring

Good people have options

You are trying to create a job that they want to do:

* Micromanaging them to ensure that you approve of every second they're on the clock for you.

One of my writers told me that she clocks out when she gets up to use the bathroom or get a drink of water and I told her that was crazy.  If someone is producing good work for me, I don't care if they spent an hour writing the article or they took a walk to clear their head for forty minutes, then wrote the article in twenty. In my experience, if you show people that you trust them to do good work and be honest, they'll do it.

You're not trying to squeeze free work out of them
You respect their craft

# Create a detailed job description

* Examples of what you want or don't want (be careful what you wish for because they're going to use it as a template). Be real specific about what you don't like.

# Finding writers

* Upwork
* /r/hireawriter
* Professional referrals

I also posted flyers at a local college, but it only got one response and it was a weak candidate.

# Pay per hour or pay per word?

# Sending offers

Invest time in screening. When you invite people to apply, mention specifics about their stuff.

# Evaluating candidates

Don't hope that you can fix bad writers. They're going to stay the same.

# Use a style guide to enforce consistency

You can create this

Some writers use the term "website" and some use "web site" then your site is messy.

Iterate on the style guide as you go. Instead of just telling someone that they're making a style error, link to the style guide. Don't make it too long or it's hard for people to learn.

Pay writers to learn the style guide. If you show

# Agree on an editing workflow

Instance where I would suggest an edit and she would make more edits.

# The first few drafts

This is where the interview really begins.

* What parts take the most time?

Bad if they make the same mistakes over and over.

# Gracefully terminating bad hires

Try not to phrase it in a scary "you're about to get fired way" but like:

>For the issues we're running into, what would be helpful in reducing those?

Here is a typical note:

>Unfortunately, I need to end the contract here. Your writing is good, but we're on our eighth article, and the style is still fairly distant from what I'd like it to be.
>
>From reading the shrimp and celery articles, it looks like it would require 2-3 rounds of review before I'd feel comfortable publishing it. At that point, it's faster for me to write the reports myself.
>
>I appreciate all your work and wish you the best going forward.

And then here is probably my harshest one:

>That's twice in a row that you promised work by a certain date and didn't deliver or give an update, so I'm afraid I need to end our relationship here.
>
>I mailed you a check on Saturday for your hours. I don't need edits on the remaining articles.
>
>Best of luck in the future.
