Foo.
* Not a guide to hiring a cheap person to pump out words.


# Create a detailed job description

* Examples of what you want or don't want (be careful what you wish for because they're going to use it as a template). Be real specific about what you don't like.

# Finding writers

* Upwork
* /r/hireawriter
* Professional referrals

I also posted flyers at a local college, but it only got one response and it was a weak candidate.

# Pay per hour or pay per word?

# Sending offers

Invest time in screening. When you invite people to apply, mention specifics about their stuff.

# Evaluating candidates

Don't hope that you can fix bad writers. They're going to stay the same.

# Use a style guide to enforce consistency

You can create this

Some writers use the term "website" and some use "web site" then your site is messy.

# Agree on an editing workflow

Instance where I would suggest an edit and she would make more edits.

# Gracefully terminating bad hires

Here is a typical note:

>Unfortunately, I need to end the contract here. Your writing is good, but we're on our eighth article, and the style is still fairly distant from what I'd like it to be.
>
>From reading the shrimp and celery articles, it looks like it would require 2-3 rounds of review before I'd feel comfortable publishing it. At that point, it's faster for me to write the reports myself.
>
>I appreciate all your work and wish you the best going forward.

And then here is probably my harshest one:

>That's twice in a row that you promised work by a certain date and didn't deliver or give an update, so I'm afraid I need to end our relationship here.
>
>I mailed you a check on Saturday for your hours. I don't need edits on the remaining articles.
>
>Best of luck in the future.


# Meet regularly in person or on video chat
