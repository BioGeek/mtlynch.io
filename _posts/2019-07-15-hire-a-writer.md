For my last project, I interviewed 30 writers, hired 10 of them, and fired all but one. This process was far more difficult than I expected, but I learned a great deal. I'm by no means an expert at hiring writers, but I've written this guide to share what I learned.

## Who should read this guide

This guide is for people like me: small business owners who want to outsource writing to a professional. Your monthly budget for writers should be in the hundreds to thousands of dollars.

If you need a dirt cheap writer to churn out content for your spam blog, this guide isn't for you. Similarly, if you're a Fortune 500 company who can blow $50k on a writing project without noticing, most of the strategies I describe won't apply.

## What's a content writer?

One of the critical parts of hiring a content writer is knowing what a content writer is. Content writers write pieces that inform or entertain your readers (think articles, blog posts, and ebooks). They differ from *copywriters* in that copywriters write text that compels the user to perform some action, such as buy a product or subscribe to an email list. And if you're looking for someone to write technical documentation or a whitepaper, you'd likely do better to hire a *technical writer*, not a content writer.

## The fundamental principle of hiring talented people

Most of this guide is very pragmatic and based on what concrete steps I took, but there's one underlying idea that governs my philosophy for hiring for any skilled position:

* **Talented people are selective about which jobs they take**

I've read other guides that encourage clients to force writers through tedious and time-consuming hoops without pay just for the privilege of being considered for a job. The idea is that writers are so desperate for work that you can demand anything you want from them. And there certainly are writers desperate for work who will jump through all of your hoops, but they're not the writers you want. The good writers will run for the hills as soon as they hear "unpaid trial job."

If you want good writers, create work conditions that are fair, pleasant, and interesting. Show candidates that you respect and value their craft. This starts from the first message you send inviting them to apply and continues throughout your working relationship.

## Part One: Finding Writers

The first step in hiring a writer is locating the ones who are looking for work. This section outlines all the methods I used to find writers and which ones were successful.

## Part Two: Creating a Detailed Job Description

Now that you've found available writers, you need to tell them what you want. This section explains how to create a job description that minimizes ramp-up time and demonstrates to prospective candidates that you're an organized professional.

## Part Three: Screening Candidates

Once you receive applications from candidates, you need to decide who to hire and who to reject. This section covers the signals that can help you identify good candidates and how you can figure out who's a good match for your project.

## Part Four: Working with Writers
