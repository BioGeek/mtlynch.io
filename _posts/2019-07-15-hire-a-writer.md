For my last project, I interviewed 30 writers, hired 10 of them, and fired all but one. This process was far more difficult than I expected. Almost every adult can write, so how hard could it be to find someone to write simple articles?

This process has not made me an expert, but I'm much better than I was. In this post, I'll show you everything I did

This is not a guide for people who want to fill their site with cheap content so that they appear highly in search results for particular terms. This guide is for people who care about quality writing and want to work with writers who can produce it.

Throughout, I'm going to show you real examples of what I did.

# The golden rule of hiring

The underlying strategy that defines most of how I hire and work with writers:

* **Talented people are selective about which jobs they take**

When I see articles that recommend forcing writers through a rigorous screening process that includes demanding unpaid work, I think, "What a brilliant way to filter out all the good writers."

Create work conditions that are fair, pleasant, and interesting enough that good writers want to come work for you. Show candidates that you respect and value their craft. This starts from the first message you send and continues throughout the working relationship.

# Create a detailed job description

The first step in finding candidates is defining what kind of writer you want.

Remember the golden rule. A good description shows candidates that you're an organized professional who puts thought into what they want. Just be careful to avoid making it meticulously detailed that you come across as an insane control freak.

* Overview
   * What kind of content will they write?
   * What is the goal of the content?
     * Attracting attention to a product?
     * Improving search engine rankings?
     * Building a brand?
* Requirements
  * Does the writer need specialized knowledge in a particular field of study (e.g., medical writing, financial writing)?
  * Should they have particular skills (e.g., writing for SEO, appealing to a certain demographic)?
* Timing
  * How many hours per week do you expect them to put in each week?
  * How quickly must the writer complete work after they receive an assignment?
* Payment
  * What method of payment will you use?
  * How quickly can writers expect payment?
  * Do you need to collect tax information from them? (in the US, you'll need to collect a 1099 from them if you pay them more than $600 per year)

Show examples of what kind of content you want. This can be from your own site or from another site whose content is something you're using as inspiration.

Caveat: When you show writers example articles, they will naturally take those to be the template for what you want. If there are aspects of the examples you don't like, call those out.

Remember that freelance writers generally have to juggle multiple clients at once. If you're flexible about timing, it's easier to find good writers who can fit you into their schedule.

* Examples of what you want or don't want (be careful what you wish for because they're going to use it as a template). Be real specific about what you don't like.

# Finding writers


Create a contract.

### Upwork

The advantage to Upwork is that they have a contract built-in that assigns you rights to the work you hire for, so you don't need to create your own contract. They also handle all the billing and taxes, so you don't need to collect tax information from your hires.

The downside is that if you find someone through Upwork, the Upwork Terms of Use requires you to work with them exclusively through Upwork and pay Upwork fees 

The balance of power on Upwork is definitely skewed far in favor of the client. If you're unhappy with the work, you can demand a refund. This may sound good for you, but it also discourages good writers from using the platform because they don't want to be at the mercy of an unprofessional client who's empowered by the skewed platform.

### Personal referrals

Most of my friends from college have liberal arts degrees, so they know writers. I didn't want the perilous complexity of hiring personal friends, but I asked them if they knew of writers.

Depending on who referred them, it can cause bad blood if you hire them and unceremoniously fire them after their first piece. If you just choose not to hire someone, that's not usually a big deal. If you hire someone and then immediately fire them because you don't like their work, that can cause bad blood between you and whoever referred them. You can get out of hiring something by saying something complimentary and vague, like, "Your writing is good, but it doesn't match the style I had in mind."

I only found two writers through personal referrals, but they were among the top in terms of quality. They made the fewest grammatical errors and produced writing that was lively and interesting. However, I ran into issues with both of them because they missed deadlines and communicated poorly. Oddly, while most writers took a while to write according to my style guide, both the writers I hired through referrals matched the style guide closely on their first article. But then instead of getting better at it, they repeated the same mistakes or started making new ones. My sample size is only two people, so patterns aren't very meaningful, but I can imagine that more experienced writers tend to be juggling more clients at once, which might explain missing deadlines and them finding it hard to keep matching my particular style guide.

### Printed flyers

My town of South Hadley is nearby many liberal arts colleges. I thought maybe I could find a talented college student, so I put up flyers in my town and on Mt. Holyoke's campus. I received only one serious applicant, and their writing samples were just poorly-written school assignments, so I didn't have much success with this, but I also should have tried additional colleges.

### /r/hireawriter

There's a subreddit dedicated to hiring freelance writers. I checked it a few times but never found anyone that seemed like a promising candidate.

# Screening writers

Obviously, you're not going to hire every writer you find. You need a way to evaluate candidates based on their profile. You don't have much information to go on.

Some guides recommend asking writers to produce a custom sample for you where you buy it if you like it, but "let them keep it" and pay them nothing if it's not what you're looking for. I don't do this, because it violates the golden rule. I think top-tier writers are uninterested in spending hours on an assignment they'd only *maybe* receive payment for.

### Bio

In most places you find a writer.

This is purely the writer talking. In their writing samples, they often don't have control over the topics they write about or their style. The bio is purely theirs, so it's the most pure sample you can get of their writing.

For me, spelling or grammar errors in the bio are an automatic no-hire. If they can't get their grammar correct in their bio, they're never going to get it right in the work they do for me.

Red flags:

* Grammar errors
* Spelling errors
* Convoluted language
* Confusing phrasing

### Writing samples

As with the bio, read the writing sample aloud.

It's harder to judge quality in the writing samples. If they have a good piece, maybe it's because they wrote garbage and the publication's editor cleaned it up. Conversely, if the article feels boring and convoluted, it could be because the client asked for a 2,000 word article about a topic that should have taken 500 words.

When I read the writing samples, I'm looking for writing that's extremely good or extremely bad. I can reject extremely bad writing. If the writing samples are so-so, I'll reach out to the candidate and say that I'm interested and ask if they have a writing sample that matches what I'm looking for.

### Reviews

Sites like Upwork keep reviews for each freelancer. I'm not sure if there's fraud happening or if everyone's just a much softer reviewer than I am, but reviews don't seem to correlate with quality. Several writers I hired had perfect five-star ratings from dozens of reviews, and then they turned in work

 I haven't found these to be particularly valuable. There's an unfortunate trend on sites like Upwork where people generally give a perfect score to indicate There are too many low-quality blogs hiring people to produce any English, and they give five-star reviews for all work.

Negative reviews are a stronger signal. If it's just one or two clients who are upset, but their reviews are otherwise good, it's not a big deal. Some clients are just jerks and have unreasonable expectations of freelancers.

# Pay per hour, pay per word, or pay per piece?

There are several 

Good writers want to produce good writing

Assumes that writers are lazy, so you need to impose financial penalties on them to prevent that (i.e., withhold their pay until the article is completed to your satisfaction).

One of my writers told me that she clocks out when she gets up to use the bathroom or get a drink of water and I told her that was crazy.  If someone is producing good work for me, I don't care if they spent an hour writing the article or they took a walk to clear their head for forty minutes, then wrote the article in twenty. In my experience, if you show people that you trust them to do good work and be honest, they'll do it.

# Sending offers

Invest time in screening. When you invite people to apply, mention specifics about their stuff.

# Choosing a candidate

Don't hope that you can fix bad writers. They're going to stay the same.

Red flags:

* They ask questions that you've already answered
* They send you a generic form letter
* As you read their writing samples, you feel bored or struggle to pay attention

Good signs:

* They ask good probing questions
* They express genuine in the job

If it seems like the average college graduate could produce the article without any research or introspection, that's a bad sign.

# Beware of fluff factories

You'll recognize it if it sounds like you're reading a book report from a fifth grader who forgot to do the reading.

To avoid picking on any candidate, I made up the example below, but it is alarmingly similar to many of the writing samples I saw during hiring:

>Fitness is important. We all know this! A recent study found that people who exercise are better than people who don’t. So you don’t have any excuse not to hit the gym and start working on those extra pounds!
>
>But fitness won’t just happen. You have to work for it. The first step is making a commitment that will force you to keep a regular gym habit. It can be a pact with a friend or sessions with a personal trainer. Anything that will keep your butt off the couch!
>
>Don’t overdo it either! Many people start working out and push themselves past their limits and receive injury. Make sure to know your limits and always stay hydrated.

# Use a style guide to enforce consistency

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uy19xtf_PFW0LJ2Zj6cSkH2dhHED8PCjHCtup1_IQ_4/edit#heading=h.qwnjmopyhpr6

Make it a Google Doc or a wiki where there's a single, authoritative copy of it. If the style guide is in an email or a Word Document, it's hard to update and ensure that everyone's working from the same copy.

You shouldn't try to cover everything in the English language. Just the things that come up frequently for your site. For example, Is It Keto was about the keto diet, so my style guide had detailed instructions on how to format measurements and how to abbreviate words like "carbohydrates" and "ketogenic."

You can create this

Some writers use the term "website" and some use "web site" then your site is messy.

Iterate on the style guide as you go. Instead of just telling someone that they're making a style error, link to the style guide. Don't make it too long or it's hard for people to learn.

Pay writers to learn the style guide. If you show

# Agree on an editing workflow

You've hired a writer and created a style guide. Now, they need to start writing for you. But a lot has to happen between them writing the first draft and you publishing their content.

Here's the editing workflow I used with writers for Is It Keto:

1. I create a Google Doc with the template of an article. (TODO: show example)
1. I share the Google Doc with the writer and ask them to fill in the template.
1. Writer emails me to let me know when they have a draft ready for me to review.
1. I add margin comments to the Google Doc and make inline edits in "Suggesting" mode.
1. I email the writer to let them know when my edits are complete.
1. Repeat steps 3-5 until the article is ready to publish.

There will be bumps. Every workflow is different. I ran into a recurring issue with one of my writers where I'd make an inline edit to improve her phrasing. She'd see it pop up as a suggestion and, rather than accepting the suggestion, she'd revise it to something else. This was frustrating because I was ready to publish the version I suggested and then she changed it to something else I didn't like. Finally, I asked her what she was doing and it turned out that she was afraid I'd think she was lazy if she just took my suggestion and did nothing else.

Minimize the rounds of review. Look for patterns that are coming up and see if you can put these into 

Instance where I would suggest an edit and she would make more edits.

# Evaluating their first few drafts

This is where the interview really begins.

* What parts take the most time?

Bad if they make the same mistakes over and over.

Start small and easy and work your way up to harder pieces.

Try to put corrections in your style guide first. Then, send a link. In the likely even that you end up working with another writer, you don't have to go through this process again.

# Gracefully terminating bad hires

Try not to phrase it in a scary "you're about to get fired way" but like:

>What can I do to help reduce these issues?

Here is a real letter I wrote to one of the writers that didn't work out:

>Unfortunately, I need to end the contract here. Your writing is good, but we're on our eighth article, and the style is still fairly distant from what I'd like it to be.
>
>From reading the shrimp and celery articles, it looks like it would require 2-3 rounds of review before I'd feel comfortable publishing it. At that point, it's faster for me to write the reports myself.
>
>I appreciate all your work and wish you the best going forward.

And this one is my harshest:

>That's twice in a row that you promised work by a certain date and didn't deliver or give an update, so I'm afraid I need to end our relationship here.
>
>I mailed you a check on Saturday for your hours. I don't need edits on the remaining articles.
>
>Best of luck in the future.

* Stick to objective facts
* Focus on the writing rather than the person
* Avoid injecting insults or negative personal feelings about their work

# Meet regularly in person or on video chat

Morgan has a blind spot for passive voice and I have a high sensitivity for it. She would often submit work using the passive voice and it would frustrate me to no end. "Why doesn't she care enough to observe this rule?" But when we met over video chat, it was immediately obvious that she cared deeply about the quality of the work, and the passive voice was just her blind spot. And we all have blind spots for errors in our writing. My [editor](/editor) always criticizes my comma usage but I, don't have, any idea what she's talking, about.

# Do it all over again

You have to work with a lot of writers to find one that you like. And with each writer you work with, you should get a better sense of what you're looking for and what you want to avoid. Before you begin interviewing again, revise your job description. Think about patterns of error with your last writer. Are there things

In my case, I noticed that I was burning a lot of time fixing grammatical errors for my writers. I thought it was a given that professional writers should use proper grammar, but in fairness, there are plenty of clients who don't care, so writers don't assume that they have to do it. Before seeking more applicants, I adjusted my job description to say that writers needed to use proper grammar. When I had subsequent writers submit content with grammatical errors, it was easier to say, "Hey, a lot of grammar errors are slipping though. Can you use a tool like Grammarly to check your writing before sending it to me?"

* Revise your job description
* Update your "example pieces"
* Re-read your style guide
  * Are there patterns of error that keep coming up that you can cover in your style guide?
