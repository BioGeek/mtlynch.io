In this post, I'll show you how to generate pre-rendered pages using Vue and Nuxt.

## Creating a reusable Vue + Nuxt pre-rendering template

Rendering two pages was probably the thrill of a lifetime, but I promised you HTML tags for SEO and social sharing. For the rest of the post, I'm going to show you how to build on the hello world example step by step until you have a project template with all the standard features you'd expect of a modern web app.

## Adding a default layout

Okay, back to developing your app. We started out with two pages. I wrote them as two completely independent pages, but for real web apps, pages tend to share a lot of content. For example, navigation bars, footers, and HTML tags.

You can refactor common code out of your pages by creating a layout.

### `layouts/default.vue`

```html
<template>
  <div class="app">
    <div class="nav horizontal-align">
      <nuxt-link class="nav-item" to="/">
        Home
      </nuxt-link>
      <nuxt-link class="nav-item" to="/about">
        About
      </nuxt-link>
    </div>
    <!-- The <nuxt> tag inserts the unique content for the particular page -->
    <nuxt class="container" />
  </div>
</template>

<style>
body,
html {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 20px;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
.nav-item {
  text-decoration: none;
  font-size: 1.2em;
}
</style>
```

Now, your pages have a navigation bar:

## Setting unique page titles for SEO

You may have noticed that these pages have no title. Time to fix that!

### `pages/index.vue`

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>I'm an example of a pre-rendered Vue webpage.</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  head: {
    title: 'Home page',
  },
};
</script>
```

### `nuxt.config.js`

```javascript
export default {
  head: {
    titleTemplate: '%s | Hello World Vue Static',
  },
};
```

## Deploying to Firebase

Web apps are more fun when you can show your friends, so next I'm going to show you how to publish your app (for free).

I like Firebase's static hosting, but several other providers offer static hosting, including [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/10/27/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-a-static-site-or-single-page-app/), [Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html), and [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website).
