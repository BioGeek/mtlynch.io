Today marks a full year of working for myself after quitting my job as a software engineer at Google.

# How I made and spent money

Money is one of the biggest motivators and obstacles to starting your own business. It's the thing most people are interested in, so I'll start there.

Table of what I spent money on and what I earned money from.

# Not having money is stressful

I believe I'm the first person to ever make this observation, but it's hard to not have much money.

Weird not to have money coming in. Didn't really feel weird until I got rid of cash. Had lots of cash from selling investments Google bonus payout. Got weird when I have to sell investments to cover my costs because the more investments I sell, the less money I earn from investments.

# Why I'm not consulting

People keep offering me consulting jobs. The only way I'd do it is if it were $10k per week. Even though I'm not making money from my businesses, I'm hopefully gaining skills to make me better at launching businesses.

# Staying motivated

Hasn't been a problem. Biggest problem is knowing when to quit or pivot.

# I still love it

I dread going back
