I started this blog in May 2016. I don't mean to brag, but within my first year, I was pulling in upwards of *twenty* visitors per day, several of whom were not spam bots. That number could reach as high as *fifty* on days when I made a new post and begged for readers through all of my social media channels.

The size of my audience changed a bit in May 2017. The sharp-eyed reader may be able to spot the subtle change in my traffic graphs:

![Blog traffic graphs](/images/2017-07-25-editor/full-traffic-graph.png){: .align-center}

As you might notice from the graph, my readership went from "too insignificant to appear in a graph" for almost the entire first year of the blog to to over 9,000 readers per week. In weeks where I published a new post, this number could reach as high as 50,000.

## What changed?

Just before I went to bed on May 13, 2017, I made [this post](https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~016a16f965a246c00f) to Upwork, a site I use regularly for hiring freelancers. When I woke up the next morning, I was surprised to find that I had received applications from ten different freelancers overnight. 

[![Job posting for editing position](/images/2017-07-25-editor/editing-job-post-sm.png){: .align-right}](/images/2017-07-25-editor/editing-job-post.png)

It was an interesting pool of applicants. The applicants included a librarian, a PhD in Rhetoric and Composition, and a journalist. Some were obviously not good matches. The lowest bidder, at $8/hr, told me she was, "well-equipped with knowledge how to teach writing." Another mentioned in her cover letter that, "editing and writing are [her] forte's [sic]."

The strongest applicant was an editor named [Samantha Mason](https://www.upwork.com/fl/samanthamason). At $55/hr, she was almost twice as expensive at the next highest bidder. But she was also the only one who showed that she had actually read any of my writing. In her cover letter, she pointed out that I had a habit of diluting my writing with helper verbs. "As you **can see** in the graph below" instead of simply, "As you **see** the graph below."

Samantha was also a great match because she had a background in engineering. She is a programmer as well and could understand some of my more software-centric posts.

I offered Samantha the job the same morning. By 10 AM, she accepted the job. In less than 12 hours I went from sitting down to write the job posting to starting a contract with a qualified match.

Note: Because this whole post is about copy editing and Samantha's work specifically, I felt it would be fitting for her to edit this piece~~, so if all the negative passages about her have been removed, that's why.~~

## Why an editor?

When you publish a blog post, you typically don't get back much feedback about why it was or was not successful. All the feedback mechanisms you have are very fuzzy. If you publish a post that flops, readers aren't going to email you and say, "Hey, your sentence structure was too repetitive, so it prevented me from connecting with the piece."

Writing is a very generalizable skill, useful far beyond writing blog content.

"An editor, you say?"

But for me, the most important reason to hire an editor was to mislead friends and family into thinking that I was

## Tell a story

One of the key insights I got from my editor was on my TaskRabbit post. In that post, I described hiring a chef from a task hiring service called TaskRabbit. It was the only post that wasn't about writing or installing software. This was 

>What are you trying to accomplish with this story? If it’s just the facts, you’ve done that, but I think you can do more. This is creative writing. Have fun with it. Make the reader laugh. Make the reader want to keep reading.

My first thought was, "This is just an explanation of how I hired a chef. What *story*?" I wrote the post because I had told a few friends about hiring a chef and people seemed interested in the details of it, "How much did it cost? How did you find a chef?" It seemed natural to me to write a blog post that mainly just answers those questions.

After I thought about it for a few days, I thought, "Why *can't* I tell it like a story?"

It immediately became the all-time most upvoted story on [/r/siacoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Siacoin/top/) and [/r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/top/). I was later shamefully bumped from /r/CryptoCurrency by a picture of a sign). It also made it to the front page of Hacker News, a popular site for sharing technology news.


I don't recall seeing this in comments on other blog posts, though it should be noted that I don't recognize praise unless it's directed at me.

The feedback seemed like such clear validation of my decision to hire an editor that I almost had to wonder if Samantha was surreptitiously posting these comments herself through different accounts she controls. *[Editor's note: There is no evidence to support this allegation.]*


## Read it aloud

One of the most valuable tips Samantha gave me was to read my writing aloud. This tip alone would have been worth

Oh wow, that does not sound at all like something a human would say.

## Drastically expand your audience in six words

I live in Manhattan, where Seamless is popular enough that it's not uncommon to hear my friends say, "Want to come over and we'll get Seamless?" Samantha lives in Wisconsin, where Seamless is not popular, so when I just dropped "Seamless" into a post as if it was self-explanatory, she didn't know what I was talking about.

My blog is for people who are exactly me, but who haven't yet figured out how to do the thing I just figured out how to do.

## If your editor told you to jump off a bridge, would you do that too?

You don't have to do everything your copy editor tells you to do.

There was one line in 

It should still sound like you.

An editor alone isn't going to

Writing is a skill that's useful for life in many different jobs. Like salesmanship or charm.

You can see that until May 15th, I had fewer than 100 visitors per week.
