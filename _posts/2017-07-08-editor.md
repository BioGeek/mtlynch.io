I started this blog in May 2016. I don't mean to brag, but within my first year, I was pulling in upwards of *twenty* visitors per day, several of whom were not spam bots. That number could reach as high as *fifty* on days when I made a new post and begged for readers through all of my social media channels.

The size of my audience changed a bit in May 2017. The sharp-eyed reader may be able to spot the subtle change in my traffic graphs:

TODO: Change to "users" not "sessions"

As you might notice from the graph, my readership went from "too insignificant to appear in a graph" for almost the entire first year of the blog's existence to to over 9,000 readers per week starting this May. In weeks where I published a new post, this number could reach as high as 50,000.

The month-over-month growth was incredible:

| Month | Unique visitors | Growth (one month) | Growth (two months) |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| April 2017    | 251                           | -                                            | -                                                 |
| May 2017      | 5,572                      |  2,119% / 22x               | -                                                 |
| June 2017      | 113,121               | 1,930% / 20x                | **44,968% / 450x**       |

## What changed?

Just before I went to bed on May 13, 2017, I made [this post](https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~016a16f965a246c00f) to Upwork, a site I use regularly for hiring freelancers. It was a job listing for an editor to give me feedback on my blog. Not a permanent position, just a one-time job to read through my writing and identify weak or incorrect patterns in my writing and suggest improvements.

 When I woke up the next morning, I was surprised to find that I had received applications from ten different freelancers overnight. The applicants included a librarian, a PhD in Rhetoric and Composition, and a journalist. Some were obviously not good matches. The lowest bidder, at $8/hr, told me she was, "well-equipped with knowledge how to teach writing." Another mentioned in her cover letter that, "editing and writing are [her] forte's [sic]."

The strongest applicant was an editor named [Samantha Mason](https://www.upwork.com/fl/samanthamason). At $55/hr, she was almost twice as expensive at the next highest bidder. But she was also the only one who showed that she had actually read any of my writing. In her cover letter, she pointed out that I had a habit of diluting my sentences with helper verbs. "As you **can see** in the graph below" instead of simply, "As you **see** in the graph below." She also had an engineering background, something I felt was a major 

Samantha was also a great match because she had a background in engineering. She is a programmer as well and could understand some of my more software-centric posts.

I offered Samantha the job that same morning, and by 10 AM, she accepted. The entire process from writing the job posting to making a hire took less than 12 hours.

Note: Because this whole post is about copy editing and Samantha's work specifically, I felt it would be fitting for her to edit this piece~~, so if all of my negative comments about her have been removed, that's why.~~

## Why hire an editor?

When I publish a blog post and it flops, I don't get good feedback about *why* it flopped. To date, none of my readers have written me to say, "Hey, your sentence structure in that last post was too repetitive, so it prevented me from connecting with the piece."

Writing is a very generalizable skill, useful far beyond writing blog content, much like humor, charm, or archery.

For me, the most important reason to hire an editor was to give friends,  family, and co-workers a misleadingly grandiose perception of my blog. Before, when I would tell someone that  I wrote a new blog post about [using Selenium to test Ansible roles](/testing-ansible-selenium/), they would nod politely and change the subject. But I noticed that when I started saying things like, "I'm revising my [GreenPiThumb blog post](/greenpithumb/) because my editor thinks that the introduction is too weak," they'd invariably respond with, "Your *editor*?"

## Learning from my mistakes

Samntha had plenty of useful feedback for me. Her notes included tons of mistakes I had no idea I was making.

* I often switched point of view
	*  e.g. "First, **you** should download this package... Then **we** click this icon."
* I overused parentheticals (often using them to cram in extra information I didn't feel merited a new sentence)
* I used a lot of fluff words that didn't add to what I was saying.
	*  e.g. "I don't **really** like cooking" simplifies to, "I don't like cooking" with better word economy and no loss of clarity.

One surprising insight was how frequently I made the assumption that my readers shared my frame of reference. Extremely popular in Manhattan. Not so popular in Wisconsin, where Samantha lives.

## What are you trying to accomplish with this story?

The most valuable advice Samantha gave me was in response to a post where I described [using an odd job service to hire a private chef](/taskrabbit-cooking/):

>What are you trying to accomplish with this story? If it’s just the facts, you’ve done that, but I think you can do more. This is creative writing. Have fun with it. Make the reader laugh. Make the reader want to keep reading.

My first thought was, "What *story*? This is just an explanation of how I hired a chef." I wrote the post because I had told a few friends what I did. People seemed amused by the process and they were interested in the logistics of it: "How much did it cost? How did you pick the chef?" It seemed natural to me that a blog post would just answer those questions.

After letting the suggestion roll around my head for a few days, I thought, "Why *can't* it be a story?" People love stories. I had a backlog of ideas for blog post topics,  and I started thinking about how I could write them in story form.

## Telling it like a story

A few weeks later, I was browsing reddit when I saw a user post an "almost correct" version of their password I realized that this could be one of those "stories" that Samantha had been telling me about.

I wrote the post 

By the end of the day, it was most upvoted story of all time on both [/r/siacoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Siacoin/top/) and [/r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/top/) (though a few days later, I was shamefully bumped from the #1 spot on /r/CryptoCurrency by [a picture of a sign](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/6i5ibl/its_happening/). It also made it to the front page of Hacker News, a popular link-sharing site for tech enthusiasts.

I also noticed something interesting about the comments on the article. Many of them specifically commented on how much they appreciated the writing style.

I didn't recall seeing this in comments on other blog posts, though it should be noted that I don't recognize praise unless it's directed at me.

The feedback seemed like such clear validation of my decision to hire an editor that I almost had to wonder if Samantha was surreptitiously posting these comments herself through different accounts she controlled. *[Editor's note: There is no evidence to support this allegation.]*


## Read it aloud

One of the most valuable tips Samantha gave me was to read my writing aloud. This tip alone would have been worth

Oh wow, that does not sound at all like something a human would say.

TODO: Put in Samantha's quote about your brain catching errors

TODO: Find article explaining the science

## If your editor told you to jump off a bridge, would you do that too?

You don't have to do everything your copy editor tells you to do.

*[Editor's note: Ignore this section]*

There was one line in 

It should still sound like you.

## Closing thoughts

An editor alone isn't going to 

Writing is a skill that's useful for life in many different jobs. Like salesmanship or charm.
