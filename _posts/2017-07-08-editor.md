# A year in blogging

I started this blog in May 2016. I don't mean to brag, but by the end of my first year blogging, I was pulling in upwards of **20 visitors per day**, several of whom were not spam bots. That number could reach as high as **50** on days when I made a new post and begged for readers through every social media channel at my disposal.

The size of my audience changed a bit in May 2017. The sharp-eyed reader may be able to spot the subtle change in my traffic graphs:

</figure>


As you might notice from the graph, my readership went from "too insignificant to appear in a graph" for almost the entire first year of the blog's existence to to over 9,000 readers per week starting last May. In weeks where I published a new post, I had over 40,000 visitors.

In June, my total number of visitors was 450 times higher than it had been two months prior:

| Month | Unique visitors | Growth (one month) | Growth (two months) |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| April 2017    | 251                           | -                                            | -                                                 |

| June 2017      | 113,121               | 1,930% / 20x                | **44,968% / 450x**       |

# What changed?

Just before I went to bed on May 13, 2017, I made a job posting to Upwork, a site I use regularly for hiring freelancers. The listing was for an editor for my blog. Not a permanent position, just a one-time gig to read through my posted articles to identify weak patterns in my writing and suggest improvements.

When I woke up the next morning, I was surprised to find that I had already received applications from ten different freelancers. Some of the matches seemed strong. There were PhDs, journalists, and writing teachers.

Some of the matches were... not so strong. The lowest bidder, at $8/hr, told me she was, "well-equipped with knowledge how to teach writing." Another freelancer mentioned in her cover letter that, "editing and writing are [her] forte's [sic]."

The strongest applicant was an editor named [Samantha Mason](https://www.upwork.com/fl/samanthamason). At $55/hr, she was almost twice as expensive at the next highest bidder. But she was also the only one who showed that she had actually read any of my writing. In her cover letter, she pointed out that I had a habit of diluting my sentences with helper verbs. "As you **can see** in the graph below," instead of simply, "As you **see** in the graph below."

Samantha was also a great match because she had a background in engineering. She told me in her cover letter that she was a programmer as well, so I thought this would make it easier for her to understand some of my more software-heavy posts.

I offered Samantha the job that same morning, and by 10 AM, she accepted. The entire process from writing the job posting to making a hire took less than 12 hours.

Note: Because this whole post is about copy editing and Samantha's work specifically, I felt it would be fitting for her to edit this piece~~, so if all of my negative comments about her have been removed, that's why.~~

# Why hire an editor?

When I publish a blog post and it flops, I don't get much feedback about *why* it flopped. To date, none of my readers have written me to say, "Hey, you had some great ideas in that post, but I never read them because your repetitive sentence structure lost my attention, so I closed the tab."

Even beyond blogging, writing is one of those skills that's useful in a wide variety of contexts, much like humor, charm, or archery.

TODO: Reword so it doesn't sound like I'm saying writing is useful in archery.

For me, the most important reason to hire an editor was to give friends,  family, and co-workers a misleadingly grandiose perception of my blog. Before, when I would tell someone that  I wrote a new blog post about [using Selenium to test Ansible roles](/testing-ansible-selenium/), they would nod politely and change the subject. But I noticed that when I started saying things like, "I'm revising my [GreenPiThumb blog post](/greenpithumb/) because my editor thinks that the introduction is too weak," people now respond inquisitively, "Your *editor*?"

# Learning from my mistakes

Samantha had plenty of useful feedback for me. Her notes included tons of mistakes I had no idea I was making.

As soon as I began reading Samantha's notes, I knew I had made the right decision in hiring an editor. She pointed out several mistakes that I had no idea I was making. Some were small things like omitting commas or overusing parentheticals (often using them to cram in extraneous information that wasn't worth including).

One surprising insight was how frequently I made the assumption that my readers shared my frame of reference. Samantha pointed out that in one post, I mention Seamless without explaining what that is. Seamless is a food delivery service: extremely popular in Manhattan, not so popular in Wisconsin, where Samantha lives. When I mentioned it in the post, I never thought twice about explaining what it was, but Samantha's note made me realize how frequently I was alienating my audience when it would be so easy not to.

# What are you trying to accomplish with this story?

The most valuable advice Samantha gave me was in response to a post where I described [using an odd job service to hire a private chef](/taskrabbit-cooking/):

>What are you trying to accomplish with this story? If it’s just the facts, you’ve done that, but I think you can do more. This is creative writing. Have fun with it. Make the reader laugh. Make the reader want to keep reading.

My first thought was, "What *story*? This is just an explanation of how I hired a chef." I wrote the post because I had told a few friends what I did. People seemed amused by the process and they were interested in the logistics of it: "How much did it cost? How did you pick the chef?" It seemed natural to me that a blog post would just answer those questions.

After letting the suggestion roll around my head for a few days, I thought, "Why *can't* it be a story?" People love stories. I had a backlog of ideas for blog post topics,  and I started thinking about how I could write them in story form.

# Telling it like a story

A few weeks later, I was browsing reddit when I saw a user post an *almost correct* version of the password that protected their cryptocurrency holdings. I figured out an interesting way of reconstructing their correct password and used it to steal their money. Don't worry, I gave it back.

I felt that people would be interested in the technique I used, and I started thinking about how I could write about it for my blog. Then it hit me: this could be one of those "stories" that Samantha had been telling me about.

I wrote the post in a continuous four-hour sprint. I had never had so much fun writing a blog post. It was silly and self-effacing and included tongue-in-cheek pop culture references — all attributes that my previous blog posts were missing. I thought presenting it in story format might make it more compelling to read, but I hadn't anticipated how much easier it made the article to write.

The next morning, I published the article, ["How I Stole Your Siacoin,"](/stole-siacoins/) and posted the link to [reddit](https://reddit.com) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), two popular link-sharing sites. By the end of the day, it was most upvoted story of all time on two of reddit's subforums, [/r/siacoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Siacoin/top/) and [/r/cryptocurrency](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/top/) (though a few days later, I was shamefully bumped from the #1 spot on /r/CryptoCurrency by [a picture of a sign](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/6i5ibl/its_happening/)). It had also gained enough traction on Hacker News to make it to their front page, an esteemed spot for tech bloggers.

I also noticed something interesting about the comments on the article. Many of them specifically praised the *style* of my writing:

I browse reddit a lot and I don't recall seeing many commenters compliment a submission on its writing — though it should be noted that I don't recognize praise unless it's directed at me.

The feedback seemed like such clear validation of my decision to hire an editor that I almost had to wonder if Samantha was surreptitiously posting these comments herself. *[**Editor's note**: There is no evidence to support this allegation.]*

# Before and after

You're probably thinking, "That's just one article. He probably got lucky." Or at least that's what I thought after the article got much more attention than I was expecting. But the next article I published got a similarly positive response. 

If you compare the readership between the three articles I published before working with Samantha to the three I wrote after, the difference is unmistakable:

## Before working with an editor

| Article | Readers (First 24 hours) | Readers (First 30 days) |
|-------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| ["Automated Prosper Investing with ProsperBot"](/prosperbot/) | 21 | 95 |
| ["Adventures in Outsourcing: Cooking with TaskRabbit"](/taskrabbit-cooking/) | 15 | 88 |
| ["Building a Homelab VM Server"](/building-a-vm-homelab/) | 414 | 1,103 |

## After working with an editor

| Article | Readers (First 24 hours) | Readers (First 30 days) |
|-------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| ["A Beginner’s Guide to Mining Siacoin"](/windows-sia-mining/) | 709 | 27,871 |
| ["How I Stole Your Siacoin"](/stole-siacoins/)  | 38,808 | 62,425 |
| ["GreenPiThumb: A Raspberry Pi Gardening Bot"](/greenpithumb/) | 27,908 | 38,295 (and counting)  |

# How much does it all cost?

As I mentioned earlier, I was not seeking to hire someone to edit my articles on an ongoing basis. The purpose of hiring Samantha was that we could do a one-time review of my writing and I would use what she taught me.

I didn't want to depend on an editor. But Samantha tricked me because her work is so good that now I want to work with her on an ongoing basis.

| Article | Cost | Notes |
|---------|-------|---------|
| ["Running Sia on a Synology NAS via Docker"](/sia-via-docker/) | $110 (2 hours @ $55/hr) | [Detailed notes](/files/Sia-NAS.pdf)  |
| ["Adventures in Outsourcing: Cooking with TaskRabbit"](/taskrabbit-cooking/) | $110 (2 hours @ $55/hr) | [Detailed notes](/files/TaskRabbit.pdf)  |
| Various articles | $55 (1 hour @ $55/hr) | [High-level notes](/files/Multi-article-notes.pdf)  |
| ["GreenPiThumb: A Raspberry Pi Gardening Bot"](/greenpithumb/) | $110 (2 hours @ $55/hr) | [Detailed notes](/files/GreenPiThumb.pdf)  |
| **Total** | **$385 (7 hours @ $55/hr)** | - |

The twist is that Samantha tricked me because I didn't anticipate how effective she would be, so now I probably will work with her on an ongoing basis, but not for every article and likely not at the same level of depth as her first few reviews.

Out of the three articles I wrote after I started working with Samantha, she only edited one of them, the GreenPiThumb post.

# Suggestions for working with editors

If you're a blogger and you're considering hiring an editor in a similar fashion, here are some recommendations based on my experience:

## Hire an expert

When you post to a freelancing site like Upwork, you invariably receive cheap offers from people willing to take any job the can get. Do not be tempted to save money by hiring a cut-rate editor. If you're going to the trouble of hiring someone, hire an expert who can give you excellent guidance. If you were getting surgery, you wouldn't hire the cheapest among the people who have access to a scalpel. An investment in expert feedback on your writing will pay dividends for a long time.

Freelancer sites will let you see your applicants' ratings and reviews for past clients. Prefer applicants with at least 10 previous jobs and a success rate that's at least 90%.

Scrutinize their cover letter. For an editor, it's essentially a sample of their work. Did they send you a form letter that they blast to everyone or did they customize it to address what you requested help on? The grammar in their cover letter should be impeccable, with wording that is clear and easy to understand.

## Look for subject matter familiarity

Find an editor who can understand and appreciate your writing. They don't have to be an expert in the subject or even understand it to the same level that you do, but they should be someone within your potential audience. If you have a blog about pop music, you don't need to hire a professional music critic, but you should look for someone with enough of an appreciation for music that they'll understand your terminology and references. If you run a mommy blog, you don't have to hire 

## Catch the easy stuff yourself

If you're going to pay a premium for an expert's time, there's no sense in squandering that time on simple mistakes you could identify on your own. Before sending your writing to an editor, run it through a tool like [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) or Microsoft Word to catch spelling and grammatical errors.

Part of your proofreading process should also be reading your posts aloud. My editor encouraged me to do this and I was astonished at how many blatant errors I overlooked by reading in my head and how much easier it is to catch sentences that sound unnatural.

## Don't take it personally

Your editor is critiquing your writing, not you. If your writing is very personal, the two can feel one and the same, but you need to detach from the writing and  but you'll get the most out of your editor's notes if you approach their feedback with an open mind.

## You don't have to accept every note

Notwithstanding the tip, remember that it's ultimately your writing and you have to decide which feedback to accept and which to ignore.

*[**Editor's note**: Pay no attention to this suggestion.]*

There have been several instances where my editor has suggested a change that I recognize is clearer or more eloquent, but it doesn't sound like my voice. In those cases, I try to rewrite to move closer to the suggestion, but occasionally, I just decide that what I wrote is what I want.

## Make your own checklist

Every time I write a new blog article, I review the notes for the last article that my editor read for me. For mistakes I find myself repeating, I
