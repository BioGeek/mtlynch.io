At the start of each month, I [declare what I'd like to accomplish](/retrospectives/2019/10/#goals-for-next-month). Here's how I did against those goals:

### Earn $100 in revenue from sales of keto meal plans

* **Result**: I hired a writer who's able to write well in the style I want.
* **Grade**: A


### Add five new articles to Is It Keto

* **Result**: It hasn't happened yet, but I'm pretty close.
* **Grade**: C+


### Appear on a podcast aimed at freelancers or entrepreneurs to talk about my writing guide

* **Result**: I published "[Hiring Content Writers: A Guide for Small Businesses](/hiring-content-writers/)"
* **Grade**: A
