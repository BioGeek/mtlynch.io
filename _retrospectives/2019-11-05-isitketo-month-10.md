RapidAPI is my payment processor, and they have a one-month lag before they even tell me how much customers have spent on my API. The revenue for October reflects activity in September.

Based on activity in October, there might be a substantial increase in revenue coming in November. There was an 8x increase in API calls from September to October, though that doesn't necessarily mean an 8x increase in revenue because not all API calls cost the same. I added better logging so that I can track my earnings in real time going forward instead of waiting a month for RapidAPI to reveal their numbers.

## My many attempts to sell meal plans

### Drop prices

### Reach out to individuals on Reddit

### Offer discounts for feedback

### Go back to square one

### Split up sales pages
