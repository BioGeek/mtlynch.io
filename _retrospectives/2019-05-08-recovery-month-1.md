# One-Line Summary

How I doubled revenues by doing absolutely nothing.

# Highlights

* Is It Keto's revenue doubled to $82.44 with zero effort on my part.
* Being inactive on Is It Keto's social media does not seem to affect the bottom line.
* Progress began on my next project.

# Goal Grades

At the start of the month, I [gave up on Is It Keto](/retrospectives/2019/04/#calling-it-quits) and set goals to help me pursue other projects. Here's how I did against those goals.

**Learn Vue.js**

* **Result**: Went through the [Vue guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) and used Vue to implement a basic site.
* **Grade**: A

I'm definitely not fluent in Vue, but I'm "conversational." I can create a website with the features that I want without getting tripped up by the language itself, which is more than I could say for Angular after ~6 months experience in it.

**Explore ideas for a new project**

* **Result**: Reached out to a few different potential customers to schedule meetings
* **Grade**: B-

I reached out to ~8 publishers and writers. Most ignored me but some of those have turned into pending meetings in May. I also called several local stone quarries who have no idea what I'm talking about when I say I want to write custom software for them, so I need to find another angle to pitch to them.

**Get back to posting full-length blog articles**

* **Result**: I published a new [blog post](https://mtlynch.io/painless-web-app-testing/) about end-to-end testing.
* **Grade**: A

I generally try to publish a new blog post each month, but I hadn't published anything since February because I got busy preparing talks for software conferences. My new blog post was about a technique I discovered that allows me to test almost any web app by combining Cypress with Docker. The Cypress team was very supportive, and it reached ~14,000 readers in its first two days.

# Money for nothing

The nice thing about Is It Keto is that it just grows on its own. It's all just content so there are no maintenance tasks to keep it running, and server costs are negligible ($1.48 in total costs for the month of April).

How is this happening? Organic search drives the site's growth, but search engines only put Is It Keto in the top spot for a small number of queries. For example, in January, 25% of the site's total traffic came from just three pages: [Propel](https://isitketo.org/propel), [Pure Via Stevia](https://isitketo.org/pure-via-stevia), and [Greek Yogurt](https://isitketo.org/greek-yogurt). For whatever reason, Google ranked Is It Keto in top spots for queries related to those pages even though I had ~60 other pages at the time that rarely came up in search results.

Now, Is It Keto has 174 food articles, but only 25 of them come up in search results more than 25 times per month. But that proportion keeps growing. In February, there were only two, and in March, it increased to 18. As Google decides that more pages on Is It Keto are relevant for its search queries, site traffic grows even though I'm not doing anything.

It would be great if this growth keeps up. If revenue reaches $500/mo, I can hire back my writer so that the site's content continues to grow.

# Who's driving this Twitter?

As part of winding Is It Keto operations at the end of March, I let my Twitter manager go. As a result, my visitors from Twitter dropped from 325 in March to only 65 in April. I paid my Twitter manager $96 for March, so I was effectively paying $0.37 per visitor. Given that I only earn about $0.01 for each visitor, this wasn't profitable, so I'm better off letting the Twitter presence languish.

Twitter does still bring in some traffic because the Twitter account is just cycling through all the tweets that my writer created for each article on the site before I shut down operations.

# Simplifying the editing workflow

For Is It Keto, I worked with a content writer to supplement my own writing. One thing we struggled with was the editing workflow. Articles went through several rounds of review, but Google Docs makes it hard to highlight what changed since the last round of review. I feel like code review tools do this so much better than any tools for content editing, so I've been reaching out to writers and editors to ask them what kind of tool I could create for them to solve this problem.

I started by emailing tech publications because I thought they'd have financial incentive to smooth out this process and they'd be familiar with code review tools. None of them were interested, so I started reaching out to individual copywriters. They seem much more excited, so I've been scheduling meetings with them in May.

If you know a writer or copy editor who might be interested, please ask them to [email me](/about/). I'd love to speak with them.

# An app for rocks

One idea I liked from the book [*Start Small, Stay Small*](/book-reports/start-small-stay-small/) was the "market-first approach." Instead of picking a product and trying to sell it to a particular market, you pick a market you want to sell to, find out what they need, then build that.

I live in Western Massachusetts, so I've been looking for business that exist here that don't exist anywhere else. One business is Goshen stone quarries. [Goshen stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goshen_stone) is a type of stone that's popular for home landscaping. They have millions in revenue but seem to do most of their business through paper orders and phone calls, so I suspect there's opportunity there.

The challenge is getting them to talk to me. Because they operate fine without software, they're reluctant to talk to some guy who's probably trying to sell them something. I placed calls in April and got some "We're not sure" responses, so I'll continue to try to set up discussions with them in May.

If you know a stone quarry operator, please [email me](/about/) because I'd love an introduction.

# The What Got Done app

I have a weekly ritual to end each week where I write down shortform notes on everything I accomplished. For the past year, I just did this in a giant Google Doc but I always wished that I had a tool that was more purpose-built for the task and more easily shareable.

There's no better way to learn a new technology than to build a real product with it, so I used Vue to create the product I wanted, What Got Done.

Here's my entry for last week:

* [What Got Done - May 3rd, 2019](https://whatgotdone.com/michael/2019-05-03)

Soon, the site will be open to new users, so you can record your tasks in the same way.
