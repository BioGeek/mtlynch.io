## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I [declare what I'd like to accomplish](/retrospectives/2019/11/#goals-for-next-month). Here's how I did against those goals:

### Publish a new blog post about eliminating distractions from email and social media

* **Result**: Earned only $23.87 from keto meal plan sales.
* **Grade**: D+

It turns out it's really hard to get people to spend money on things that other sites offer for free. Despite my best efforts, I only managed to sell two meal plans, far lower than the volume I expected.

### Interview five customers for a potential new business

* **Result**: 
* **Grade**:
