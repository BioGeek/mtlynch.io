## Stats

### Is It Keto

| Unique Visitors        | 19,526    | 28,921    | <font color="green">+9,395 (+48%)</font> |
| Total Pageviews        | 53,467    | 73.469    | <font color="green">+20,002 (+37%)</font> |

Is It Keto continued growing at a rapid rate. Most of the growth in revenue came from AdSense, since I only added it to the site in mid-July, so I've never had a full month of comparison.

### Zestful

## Wrap up

### What got done?

* Conducted nine customer interviews
* Implemented a "reactions" feature for What Got Done
* Added USDA matching to Zestful
* Added support for "either/or" ingredients in Zestful
* Added Google AdSense to Is It Keto

### Lessons learned

* I don't mind banner ads so much when I control how they appear on my site.
* I can get a good reply rate by sending personalized, cold emails to founders who are ex-Google:
  * I emailed 15 founders
  * I received 7 responses (47% response rate)
  * I arranged 3 meetings (20% conversion rate)
* I need to stop tinkering with Zestful unless I can tie the need directly to a paying customer's request.

### Goals for next month

* Hire a writer for Is It Keto.
* Publish an MVP for my [email copywriter tool idea](/retrospectives/2019/07/#slowing-down-on-the-email-tool-for-copywriters).
* Publish a guide to hiring freelance content writers.
* Finish open sourcing What Got Done.
