## Stats

### [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org)

| Metric                 | July 2019 | August 2019 | Change |
|------------------------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Total Earnings         | $225.47   | $388.92   | <font color="green">+$163.45 (+72%)</font> |
| Unique Visitors        | 19,526    | 28,921    | <font color="green">+9,395 (+48%)</font> |
| Total Pageviews        | 53,467    | 73.469    | <font color="green">+20,002 (+37%)</font> |
| Domain Authority (Moz) | 6         | 7         | <font color="green">+1 (+17%)</font> |
| Ranking Keywords (Moz) | 1,442     | 2,205     | <font color="green">+763 (+67%)</font> |

Is It Keto continued growing at a rapid rate. Amazon Affiliate earning stayed flat, which is a bit worrying given that pageviews increased so rapidly, but the revenue was helped along by money from Google AdSense, as August was the first full month I ran AdSense ads.

### [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com)

| Metric                 | July 2019 | August 2019 | Change |
|------------------------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Total Earnings         | $59.57    | $728.49     | <font color="green">+$668.92 (+1123%)</font> |

August was Zestful's best month, though literally 99% of the revenue from a single customer who needed to bulk convert a huge dataset of ingredients, so I can't expect similar revenue in the future.

## Taking affiliate revenue advice from Reddit

When I used to focus on Is It Keto, I wanted to share my montly retrospectives on reddit, but I never found an appropriate subreddit. In the meantime, I discovered [/r/juststart](https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/), which is a subreddit dedicated to affiliate revenue businesses.

After several years of posting on Reddit, my feeling is that Reddit has lots of useful advice. The problem is that Reddit also has lots of poor advice from people who imagine themselves to be experts but have no practical experience with the thing they're describing. And in both cases, the advice is often served with a large helping of condescension. So a lot of the responses I got were along the lines of, "You're doing great given that you don't know what you're doing!"

Reddit does have useful advice. But they also sometimes give bad advice

## Finally a backlink for Is It Keto

Really hard and I hated it.

## College job boards might be a treasure trove

When I was hiring writers for Is It Keto, one of the methods I tried was putting up printed flyers at a local college. I only received one inquiry and it quickly became clear that the candidate was not a good match. I didn't invest much more effort into recruiting at colleges, though I did always feel like I *should* be able to find a talented writer by recruiting a student.

In August, I posted job listings on online job boards for two local colleges. It's only been about a week, and I've already received 22 inquiries from students. Quality seems to be on par with the candidate pool on Upwork, though writers on that site generally charge $30-80/hr, whereas I listed the job to students at $13/hr. That wage might sound low, but it's competitive with other jobs on the job boards, and it's appealing to students because it offers more flexibility and convenience than the other jobs (babysitting, secretarial work).

## Cool discoveries this month

Stealing a page from [Cory Zue](https://coryzue.com), I'm going to try adding recommendations of interesting things I found this month:

### [Victor Zhou's Software and Machine Learning Blog](https://victorzhou.com/)

Victor Zhou is a Facebook engineer who only began blogging in 2019 and already writes better than 90% of tech bloggers. He writes with clarity, conciseness and a keen ability to explain his thought process.

My favorite of his posts is ["Minify Your SVGs"](https://victorzhou.com/blog/minify-svgs/). It does a great job of explaining the context of the problem and the tradeoffs of different solutions.

### [Cory Zue's Solopreneur Side Project Dashboard](http://www.coryzue.com/open/)

Cory Zue is a solo developer who writes publicly and transparently about his business projects. In August, he unveiled a dashboard that shows his earnings and time investment for his different projects.

Particularly interesting is his effective wage for each project. It shows how his projects required substantial up-front investment, but eventually generate increasing amounts of revenue while demanding decreasing levels of maintenance.

### [Jimmy Lipham's Website Teardown Video](https://youtu.be/J_jGnGH3YsU)

As an exercise, Jimmy Lipham made a [live demo](https://youtu.be/J_jGnGH3YsU) of UI tweaks he made to a website in response to a [post on Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/01a9c08e6b) requesting design help. It's useful because there are so many little techniques in the video that anyone can reuse on their own sites:

* He adds [box shadows](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-box-shadow/) to draw attention to certain elements on the page
* He changes the site's backgrounds to a slightly off-white color to create contrast with page elements that have a pure white background.
* He changes the navbar background from a fixed color to a color gradient.
* He adds a bottom border to the navbar so that it transitions more gently into the main page.
* He shows how to use the [Google Fonts browser](https://fonts.google.com/) to pick out new fonts.

I highly recommend watching this video because I can't convey the full experience in writing. So much of the utility is just watching Jimmy work on the page in real time and hear him think out loud about why he's making the changes he does.
