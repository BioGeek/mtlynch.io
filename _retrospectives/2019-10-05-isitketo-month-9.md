title: Is It Keto - Month 9

## One-Line Summary



## Highlights

* After six months of 30+% growth, Is It Keto finally flattened out.
* I'm preparing to sell premium meal plans on Is It Keto.
* I hired a 

## Goal Grades

At the start of each month, I [declare what I'd like to accomplish](/retrospectives/2019/08/#goals-for-next-month). Here's how I did against those goals:

### Hire a writer for Is It Keto

* **Result**: I hired a writer who's able to write well in the style I want.
* **Grade**: A

In September, I received 25 new applications from freelance writers. I did paid trials with two of them, and made one permanent hire.

### Earn revenue through a new channel for Is It Keto

* **Result**: It hasn't happened yet, but I'm pretty close.
* **Grade**: C

In September, I explored several affiliate partnerships, but wasn't excited about them. I paused on affiliate deals to focus on a different type of partnership.

### Publish a guide to hiring freelance content writers

* **Result**: I published "[Hiring Content Writers: A Guide for Small Businesses](/hiring-content-writers/)"
* **Grade**: A

This was my longest article ever, at around 7,200 words. I've been writing it on and off since March, so it felt good to finally publish it.

One thing I'm struggling with is finding an audience for my less technical posts. For posts about programming, it's easy to just share it on reddit and Hacker News, and if people like it, it gets attention. With posts about hiring [content writers](/hiring-content-writers/), [editors](/editor/), or [cartoonists](/how-to-hire-a-cartoonist/), I don't know of channels with an audience that's interested.

### Finish open sourcing What Got Done

* **Result**: What Got Done is now [open-source](https://github.com/mtlynch/whatgotdone).
* **Grade**: A

I published What Got Done's source on Github and released it under the [Apache 2 license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/). The project already received contributions from [three external developers](https://github.com/mtlynch/whatgotdone/graphs/contributors), and it's entirely because I added the label `hacktoberfest` to a few bugs. It's a program that Digital Ocean is [running in October](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) to encourage contributions to open source projects.

So, it finally happened. Is It Keto has grown by about 30% in revenue and traffic every month this year. I knew that couldn't continue forever, and I was waiting for the day when it would level off, and it finally did.

| Metric                 | August 2019 | September 2019 | Change |
|------------------------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Total Earnings         | $728.49     | $4.51          | <font color="red">-$723.98 (-99%)</font> |

No surprises here. I knew my spike in revenue last month was an anomaly, and now it's settled back into the normal territory of $3-$40 per month.

## Creating premium meal plans for Is It Keto

## The unpleasant business of affiliate partnerships

## I'm noticeably better at hiring writers

## Thinking bigger

At the start of the year, I set a goal for myself to earn $500 per month from my businesses.

Two people, in particular, drove this.

The first is [Cory Zue](http://www.coryzue.com/), a South Africa-based Indie Hacker, and someone from whom I frequently draw inspiration. This summer, he launched a Django project template, which he for $195 per license. He could spend $500 to advertise on a Django podcast and make his money back if three listeners bought his product.

Contrast this with Is It Keto, which earns about $0.01 for each visitor to the site. If I spent $500 on to buy an ad, it would have to attract 50,000 visitors for it to be worthwhile.

The other is [Justin Mares](https://twitter.com/jwmares), specifically his [recent interview on Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/116-justin-mares-of-kettle-and-fire). He started selling bone broth online, and made $2.8M in his first year. i
