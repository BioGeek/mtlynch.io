## Overview

This past weekend, [PyGotham](https://www.pytexas.org/2019/) invited me to speak at their annual conference in Manhattan.

## Costs

I ended up spending more to attend this conference than I expected:

| Expense | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Train tickets | $95.00 |
| Lodging (two nights) | $0 (stayed with friends) |
| Uber rides | $9.08 |
| Food | $5.44 |
| **Total** | **$109.52** |

Compare this to the almost [$1,200 I spent](/retrospectives/pytexas-2019-notes/#costs) to attend PyTexas!

Beyond the monetary cost, it was expensive in terms of time. It's a two-day conference, but it wiped me out for about five days. I lost roughly a day in transit each way, and then it took me about a day to catch up on non-work errands that I'd missed while I was away. Outside that, I spent 20-30 hours preparing my slide deck and rehearsing it.

## Other thoughts

### Conferences are a good place to have ideas

### I should give a talk about stealing cryptocurrency

One of the ideas I had was to turn ["How I Stole Your Siacoin"](/stole-siacoins/) into a conference talk.

### Maybe I shouldn't ask for anything

After PyGotham, I thought I was silly to squander the opportunity to ask people to approach me with ideas for managed services they'd like to see. So, this year, I did, but nothing happened. I thought that, at worst, I'd at least get some terrible ideas ("We want MailChimp, except for free and unlimited."), but nada. Maybe I should have used the opportunity to try and attract some new users to [What Got Done](https://whatgotdone.com/).

## Three conferences per year is a good goal

At the beginning of the year, I [set a goal](/solo-developer-year-1/#goals-for-year-two) to speak at three conferences in 2019. PyTexas was conference #2, so I think one more for the year will be a good amount.

The conference completes my 2019 goal of speaking at three conferences:

1. [NERD Summit 2019](http://2019.nerdsummit.org/)
1. [PyTexas 2019](https://2019.pytexas.org/) ([my notes](/retrospectives/pytexas-2019-notes/))
1. PyGotham 2019 (this post)

The benefits for me are meeting new people, hearing about tools and techniques that I otherwise wouldn't be exposed to, and getting practice public speaking.
