## Overview

This past weekend, [PyGotham](https://www.pytexas.org/2019/) invited me to speak at their annual conference in Manhattan.

## Ratings and reviews

| Conference Attribute | Grade |
|----------------------|-------|
| Quality of talks     | C     |
| Event smoothness     | A     |
| Venue                | A     |
| How I felt about my talk | B |

### Quality of talks

I was a bit disappointed with the overall quality of the talks this year. There were a few I enjoyed ([see below](#favorite-talks)), but lots of the talks were a bit underwhelming.

Part of the problem is just that I'm not the target audience. There were lots of machine learning talks, and I think machine learning is neat, but I don't use it for my job, so I feel like I've had my fill of intro ML talks.

### Event smoothness

Kudos to the PyGotham organizers for running. As the speaker, I had all the information when I needed it. The audio and visual equipment worked well for every talk I saw. Everything ran on time. The food was tasty (albeit, a bit carb-heavy) and plentiful.

### Venue

The Pennsylvania Hotel is a great venue for conferences. There were three stages with enough seating that I never felt cramped or shut out of a talk I wanted to see. The rooms were all close together to make it easy to move between talks, and there was adequate space to have hallway conversations with other attendees.

### How I felt about my talk

See ["Critiquing my talk"](#critiquing-my-talk) (below).

## Favorite Talks

### Archiving the Internet Before it All Rots Away

**Speaker**: [Nick Sweeting](https://nicksweeting.com/) from Monadical

I never realized how big a community there is around webpage archiving and how mature their tooling is.

### Maintaining a Python Project When Itâ€™s Not Your Job

**Speaker**: [Hynek Schlawack](https://hynek.me/)

TODO

This talk had a weird ending as Hynek gets into a bit of a conflict with the timekeeper about exceeding his alotted time. He argued that the next session was lunch, so he wasn't encroaching on anyone else's time and anyone was welcome to leave if they had to. That sounded reasonable to me, and I couldn't understand why the PyGotham volunteer was being so rigid in forcing him to end. Later, when I spoke to Andy Knight, he pointed out that attendees might have felt comfortable leaving, but the supporting crew (videographer, captioner, sign language interpreter).

Other things I liked:

* Introduced me to a few tools I didn't know about:
  * [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort): Automatically sorts your Python import statements.
    * I [added it](https://github.com/mtlynch/python3_seed/pull/15) to my [Python3 boilerplate project](https://github.com/mtlynch/python3_seed).
    * I like it except that its modes are either "fix automatically" (not what I want in a build check) or "give an unhelpful failure message."
  * [Black](https://github.com/psf/black): Automatically formats Python code whitespace.
    * Interesting, but doesn't seem to provide any meaningful improvements over [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf), my preferred formatter.
  * [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): Automatically runs Python test scripts in different virtual environments.
    * I *think* I used tox about five years ago, but at the time, I was using it as a way to mock behavior in unit tests. The project now is something totally different, so I can't figure out if they changed focus after [mock](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html) made it into the standard library or if I'm just confused.
    * Anyway, it seems neat. I haven't created any projects that run in multiple Python environments, but it's good to keep in my back pocket.

**[Slides](https://mtlynch.page.link/gdbt-pg)**

This was the first time I've ever been live-captioned and had a sign language interpreter translating what I say. It was also the first time I've ever received a question *in* sign language (through an interpreter).

## Costs

I ended up spending more to attend this conference than I expected:

| Expense | Amount |
|---------|--------|
| Train tickets | $95.00 |
| Lodging (two nights) | $0 (stayed with friends) |
| Uber rides | $9.08 |
| Food | $5.44 |
| **Total** | **$109.52** |

Compare this to the almost [$1,200 I spent](/retrospectives/pytexas-2019-notes/#costs) to attend PyTexas! If conference organizers could make more of an effort to plan conferences within train-taking distance from me and close to where my friends will feed me and let me stay for free, that would make it much easier to attend conferences.

Time-wise, I did 5-10 hours of prep. It was much easier to prepare for this talk since I already had the slides from PyTexas, though I revised my presentation a bit based on my reflections from the previous conference.

## Other thoughts

### It's interesting to watch the sign language interpreter

### Conferences are a good place to have ideas

### I should give a talk about stealing cryptocurrency

One of the ideas I had was to turn ["How I Stole Your Siacoin"](/stole-siacoins/) into a conference talk.

### Maybe I shouldn't ask for anything

After PyGotham, I thought I was silly to squander the opportunity to ask people to approach me with ideas for managed services they'd like to see. So, this year, I did, but nothing happened. I thought that, at worst, I'd at least get some terrible ideas ("We want MailChimp, except for free and unlimited."), but nada. Maybe I should have used the opportunity to try and attract some new users to [What Got Done](https://whatgotdone.com/).

### It's enlightening to review CFPs

Speakers to conferences fill out "CFPs", calls for proposals. It's a few paragraphs that explain why you should speak at the conference as well as your talk's blurb in the schedule that should entice attendees to see your talk.

PyGotham is the first conferenced I've attended where attendees get to see and vote on every CFP. I've written a few CFPs, but I'd never read anyone else's before, so it was enlightening to experience it as someone with (undefined) voting power over which talk got selected.

Some takeaways:

* Reviewing CFPs is *really* draining.
  * I think there were ~300 submissions. I split it into 3-4 shifts, but I'm sure I was more patient and generous with some than others just by virtue of energy levels.
* It's tough to balance my own interests against the crowd's.
  * For example, I'm not that interested in machine learning talks, but I know others are. Do I vote for or against those?
* Snottiness plays poorly in CFPs.
  * Some of the submissions basically acted as though it was below them to fill out the CFP. There was a question like, "What is your talk about?" and then a subsequent question along the lines of, "What should attendees take away from your talk?" I saw several people give lazy answers to the latter question like, "See above" or ,"This is not meaninfully different from the first question."
  * When you've reviewed 100 CFPs and have to eliminate 90% of what you read, the snotty ones are among the easiest to reject.

### Three conferences per year is a good goal

At the beginning of the year, I [set a goal](/solo-developer-year-1/#goals-for-year-two) to speak at three conferences in 2019. PyTexas was conference #2, so I think one more for the year will be a good amount.

The conference completes my 2019 goal of speaking at three conferences:

1. [NERD Summit 2019](http://2019.nerdsummit.org/)
1. [PyTexas 2019](https://2019.pytexas.org/) ([my notes](/retrospectives/pytexas-2019-notes/))
1. PyGotham 2019 (this post)

The benefits for me are meeting new people, hearing about tools and techniques that I otherwise wouldn't be exposed to, and getting practice public speaking.
