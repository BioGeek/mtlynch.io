# One-Line Summary

While figuring out my next project, I launched a different product.

# Highlights

* My task journaling app is almost ready for publication.
* I've begun setting up meetings with potential customers about my next project ideas.
* I earned $107 from [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org) and $123 from [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com) without working on either.

# Goal Grades

At the start of the month, I [gave up on Is It Keto](/retrospectives/2019/04/#calling-it-quits) and set goals to help me pursue other projects. Here's how I did against those goals.

### Publish a minimum viable product version of What Got Done

* **Result**: What Got Done is now [live](https://whatgotdone.com).
* **Grade**: A

I launched What Got Done on [May 24th](https://whatgotdone.com/michael/2019-05-24). It hasn't gained much traction, so I'm debating whether to stick with it or try something new.

### Meet with 10 potential customers for my next product

* **Result**: Had five customer meetings (<font color="red">50% below target</font>)
* **Grade**: C

I got a bit sidetracked in adding post-launch features to What Got Done, so I had fewer customer interviews than I had hoped for. This is just a consequence of me not reaching out to enough people to request interviews.

### Publish a new blog post

* **Result**: Published ["How to Grow Quickly and Never Turn a Profit"](/keep-growing-never-profit/) on the last day of the month
* **Grade**: B+

I did publish the blog post, but I had to scramble a bit to get it in under the deadline I set for myself. I'm still trying to strike a balance between feeling like I'm rushing posts out the door before they're done and spending 40 hours editing and re-editing a single post.

# Inactive projects

### Is It Keto

Now that Is It Keto is on the backburner, I'm not going to dive as deeply into its metrics, but here's a summary of the most interesting ones:

| Metric                 | April 2019 | May 2019   | Change |
|------------------------|------------|--------------|--------|
| Total Earnings         | $82.44     | $107.25       | <font color="green">+$24.81 (+30%)</font> |
| Unique Visitors        | 7,262      | 10,984        | <font color="green">+3,722 (+51%)</font> |
| Total Pageviews        | 19,732     | 28,751       | <font color="green">+9,019 (+46%)</font> |
| Domain Authority (Moz) | 9          | 6            | <font color="red">-3 (-33%)</font> |
| Ranking Keywords (Moz) | 548        | 949          | <font color="green">+401 (+73%)</font> |

It's exciting to see that the site is still growing even though I stopped working on it in March. The growth comes from [delayed gains](/keep-growing-never-profit/#search-engines-have-a-substantial-lag) in search engine rankings.

### Zestful

[Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com), the ingredient parsing service I built last year, earned $123.85 in revenue in May. That's the first time its earnings have been more than a couple dollars in a month.

The growth came almost entirely from a single user who needed Zestful for a one-time project, so it's unlikely to repeat for long, but it's fun to get a bit of money back on a project that [cost me ~$8k](/solo-developer-year-1/#zestful).

# What Got Done: Business or Hobby?

TODO: Screenshot

I'm not sure what to do with What Got Done. My main goal was to use it as a way to learn [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). And it's a tool that's useful for me because I like logging my tasks to close out the week. I have a list of business ideas in my head, and What Got Done wasn't the one I thought was most promising.

**Option A: Let it be free**: Forget about making money from it and treat it as a tool for myself that others might use as well. If it gains traction on its own, I can later revisit the possibility of selling premium features.

**Option B: Sell harder**: Approach more businesses directly and ask them to use it and find out what's stopping them.

Option A is easier because it doesn't cost me any time. Option B seems unattractive but I can't tell if it's because I [fear rejection ](/shipping-too-late/#did-i-delay-my-launch-to-avoid-rejection) or because I'm rationally evaluating the low likelihood of success and the time it will take away from other projects more likely to succeed.

# Leave no stone unturned

The last retrospective mentioned my idea to write [software for stone quarry operators](/retrospectives/2019/05/#an-app-for-rocks). I was struggling to convince any of the quarries I approached to even speak with me because they didn't understand what I wanted.

In May, I pursued the quarry owners as much as I plan to. Here were the results:

* Owner A: Firm but polite "no"
* Owner B: In-person visit + four or five calls and could never reach the owner
* Owner C: Finally reached the owners who were friendly and open to speaking to me

The conversation with Owner C was interesting but made it seem that software for quarry owners wasn't such a hot idea. Here were some of the challenges we discussed (some are specific to this particular quarry):

* The quarry itself has no electricity.
* The quarry and large sections of the surrounding area have spotty cell phone coverage.
* Many of their clients are older and prefer to do things by phone.
  * This makes online ordering a no-go.
* Anything that requires workers to carry around phones/tablets is a non-starter:
  * They primarily use walkie-talkies and have to replace them every 12 months or so due to dust, drops, or accidental crushing.
  * Workers are generally wearing gloves, eye protection, ear protection that make it hard for them to interact with a mobile device.
* There's a lot of gruntwork in filling out forms for legal compliance, but they need paper copies on hand for audits.
  * Workers currently record information on clipboards, which are easy to use and cheap to replace in the event of damage.
  * Having to do it digitally would mean consuming the paper forms from the workers, digitizing them somehow, then printing them out again. This didn't sound appealing to anyone.

# Taking on Google Docs

The other idea I described [last month](/retrospectives/2019/05/#simplifying-the-editing-workflow) is a tool for writers that focuses on the editing and review process.

My friend David Toth (TODO: link) had just attended MicroConf, a conference for small software businesses. He told me there were plenty of writers there who would probably talk to me, so I started reaching out to speakers from the event.

What I didn't realize was that the speakers at MicroConf are a special type of writer known as conversion experts. They specialize in sales copy for websites and emails.

This was an interesting accident because I didn't really want to talk to "conversion specialists." I quickly discovered that they don't have much back and forth with their clients. They send clients the text, the copy requests some small adjustments, but that's generally it. They don't have much use for a tool that focuses on the revising phase of writing.

But it turned out that they seem like a better market than what I was originally thinking about. They're [market-first approach](/book-reports/start-small-stay-small/) is that you don't create a product and try to convince people to use it. You find people who need a product and have money to pay for it, then build it for them.

TODO: Include 1-2 sketches

I made some [sketches](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/b7df1s5z40lqd47/AADgcLG5ZmSPM9HRFwb0llPTa?dl=0)

If you know an email copywriter who might be interested, please ask them to [email me](/about/). I'd love to speak with them.
