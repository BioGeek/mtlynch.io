# One-Line Summary

While figuring out my next project, I launched a different product.

# Highlights

* My task journaling app is almost ready for publication.
* I've begun setting up meetings with potential customers about my next project ideas.
* I earned $107 from [Is It Keto](https://isitketo.org) and $123 from [Zestful](https://zestfuldata.com) without working on either.

# Goal Grades

At the start of the month, I [gave up on Is It Keto](/retrospectives/2019/04/#calling-it-quits) and set goals to help me pursue other projects. Here's how I did against those goals.

### Publish a minimum viable product version of What Got Done

* **Result**: What Got Done is now [live](https://whatgotdone.com).
* **Grade**: A

I launched What Got Done on [May 24th](https://whatgotdone.com/michael/2019-05-24).

### Meet with 10 potential customers for my next product

* **Result**: Had five customer meetings
* **Grade**: C

TODO

### Publish a new blog post

* **Result**: Published ["How to Grow Quickly and Never Turn a Profit"](/keep-growing-never-profit/) on the last day of the month
* **Grade**: B+

### Is It Keto

Now that Is It Keto is on the backburner, I'm not going to dive as deeply into its metrics, but here's a summary of the most interesting ones:

| Metric                 | April 2019 | May 2019   | Change |
|------------------------|------------|--------------|--------|
| Total Earnings         | $82.44     | $107.25       | <font color="green">+$24.81 (+30%)</font> |
| Unique Visitors        | 7,262      | 10,984        | <font color="green">+3,722 (+51%)</font> |
| Total Pageviews        | 19,732     | 28,751       | <font color="green">+9,019 (+46%)</font> |
| Domain Authority (Moz) | 9          | 6            | <font color="red">-3 (-33%)</font> |
| Ranking Keywords (Moz) | 548        | 949          | <font color="green">+401 (+73%)</font> |

It's exciting to see that the site is still growing even though I stopped working on it in March. The growth comes from [delayed gains](/keep-growing-never-profit/#search-engines-have-a-substantial-lag) in search engine rankings.

### Zestful

Zestful earned $123.85 in revenue in May, which is the first time its earnings have been more than a couple dollars. 

The growth came almost entirely from a single user who needed Zestful for a one-time project, so it's unlikely to repeat for long, but it's a fun to get a bit of money back on a project that [cost me ~$8k](/solo-developer-year-1/#zestful).
